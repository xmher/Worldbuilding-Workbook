Workbook   
Dear Writer,   
Congratulations on deciding to write a story! 
Whether it’s your first story or your 100th, 
and whether you started years ago or this 
morning, your words are valuable. 
Writing isn’t always easy, but by committing 
to this project, you’ve already done better 
than anyone who’s just dreaming about it. 
Finally, I want to thank you from the bottom 
of my heart for supporting this small 
business (actually, a super small business 
...it’s just 1 person!) 
Wishing you all the best!

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMBEFORE YOU BEGIN 
WORLDBUILDING 
While you go through this workbook, consider this question: How much of your world do you need to show to enhance and support the story? 
If there's something in the workbook that doesn't add anything to your world, you can fill it in for fun, or skip it completely and delete the pages. 
Some authors like to know every single thing about their worlds before they begin. Some don't, and that's fine! Use this workbook in a way that suits you best. 
Also try to consider how you 
can pepper these details in, or 
naturally incorporate them as 
much as possible without 
dumping too much exposition 
in one go. 
Happy worldbuilding, writer! 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COM
BEFORE YOU BEGIN 
WORLDBUILDING 
Here's some golden advice from Sir Terry Pratchett, a master of fantasy worldbuilding: 
"Apply logic in places where it wasn’t intended to exist. [...] If there is magic, where does it come from? Why isn’t everyone using it? What rules will you have to give it to allow some tension in your story? How does society 
operate? Where does the food come from? 
You need to know how your world works. 
I can’t stress that last point enough. Fantasy works best when you take it seriously. 
Taking it seriously means that there must be rules. 
If anything can happen, then there is no real suspense.” 
This doesn't mean you need to plan every single detail - it's more important to write - but it does mean some thought should go into your world.

CITIES 
& 
LANDS 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COM
HOW DO I 
NAME PLACES? 
A good guide is to find the real language that sounds closest to the one spoken in your world. 
Then google "[language] + toponymy" 
This should teach you how that real-world 
language names its towns and cities. 
English toponymy 
A lot of places are named after nature (e.g. Blackwood), or take a name inspired by a local person who owned the land (usually nobility). 
If your setting is similar to the UK or Ireland, check out the following cheat sheets that takes you through some basics, to show you how it works. You can even take a prefix from one table and add it to a suffix from the other. 
Having said that, your setting name doesn't need to mean something if it's taking up too much of your energy. It's a nice touch, but not a necessity.

MAKING 
You don't need a map. However, it can help you to visualise your world a little better. You can draw your own map, or use a builder. 
Map-Makers (Links): 
Inkarnate 
Canva (Maps) 
Aazgar's Donjon's 
World Anvil (£) Nortantis 
Should I draw my own map or generate one? 
You really don't need a map to start your story. If you want to make one, in order to flesh out your world and make it feel a bit more real, try and make it with some intentionality. Consider the needs of your story, and the vibe 
you're trying to convey. Adding 
fountains and gardens is going 
to have a different effect to 
adding lots of graveyards, 
gallows, and abattoirs.

RESOURCES 
When lands have natural resources, they can become a huge part of the culture. They might even appear on the flag. 
This resource can be used for trade with other lands, and can affect the weapons, tools, fashion, architecture, and more. 
Here are some ideas of resources to give your lands: 
Gold / Silver Ores (iron, etc) Quality stones 
Gemstones Pearls 
Amber 
Silk 
Linen 
Ivory 
Special fur 
Wool 
Sugar 
Spices 
Salt 
Animal fat 
Special plants Special beasts Magic stones Dyes 
Coral 
Coal 
Wood 
Charcoal 
Oil 
Wine/Grapes Fossils 
Adder stones 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMNATURAL 
RESOURCES Here's how they may affect culture: 
TimberArchitecture heavily relies on timber. Forests are considered sacred. Carpentry is a valued skill. 
Gold Economy revolves around mining and gold trade. Emphasis on ornate craftsmanship. 
Textile production and weaving are common jobs. 
Wool Grain 
A nomadic lifestyle may be prevalent (e.g. sheep herders) and sheeps' milk / mutton may feature heavily in the diet OR sheep may be seen as holy. 
Agriculture is central to the culture. Festivals and traditions celebrate the harvest and seasonal cycles. May worship a harvest god. 
SaltUnique food due to salt-preservation being common. Salt mining is a common job. 
SpicesUnique food. Spice markets as trading hubs. Some spices may be seen to have healing benefits. 
Metalworking may aid technological 
Ores 
advancement. Advanced weapons and tools.. Mining communities. May worship a god of the forge.

RESOURCES Here's how they may affect culture: 
Tea cultivation, preparation, and rituals are part 
Tea 
Clay 
Fish / Sea / Ports 
Gems Coal 
of the culture's traditions. Tea houses are social hubs. Tea trade impacts regional / international relations. 
May have advanced pottery-making and ceramic arts. Clay-based construction materials influence architecture. Cuisine uses clay-based tools. 
Fish and seafood-based cuisine. Fishermen, pearl divers, sailmakers, sailors and other sea-related jobs may be common in a coastal nation. May 
worship sea gods. Nation may have a strong navy, and/or a tradition of sea faring trade and exploration. May be a trade hub due to the ports. Seashells may be used in crafts & jewellery. 
Mining and jewellery making thrive. Cultural celebration may revolve around elaborate jewelled ornaments or garments. 
Coal mining is popular. Mining towns pop up around coal-rich areas. Technology may develop quickly due to coal power, leading to 
advancements in manufacturing, transportation, communication, and more. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMA BRIEF NOTE ON 
ARCHITECTURE 
What do your civilisations look like? A palace can look so different depending on your culture, as can a peasant's house. 
  
  
  
BATTLEMENTS? PYRAMID OF STEPS? DOME TOPS? 
If you want to echo the feel of an architectural style from a real culture, make a list of 
distinctive elements seen in their buildings. See which ones you can use when describing your own world. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMWRITING YOUR WORLD'S 
ARCHITECTURE 
The weather of your land (as well as your land's culture) will affect the architecture. 
Rainy: May have sloped roofs, covered 
walkways, gutter systems and overhangs. Life may be more concentrated indoors. 
Snowy: Reinforced roofs (to avoid collapse), thicker insulation, snow sheds or snow fences to control snow accumulation, vestibules or mudrooms to trap melting snow 
Windy/Coastal: Streamlined shapes, reinforced structures, impact-resistant windows and doors, windbreaks, and secure anchoring systems 
Hot/Sunny: Shading elements such as eaves, awnings, or louvers, high thermal mass materials for passive cooling, cross-ventilation by strategic window placement, courtyards or atriums, and flat, light-coloured roofs to reduce heat absorption. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMHOW TO WRITE YOUR WORLD'S

HISTORY &
POLITICS 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMDO YOU NEED TO WRITE YOUR WORLD'S HISTORY? 
Your world did not just spring out of 
nowhere. Worlds seem more real and more complex if their histories are shown. 
This helps your world to feel tangible, and less like a two-dimensional movie set. 
This doesn't mean you have to spend 7 paragraphs explaining origins of grain tax. 
However, history is all around us. Do your characters hang out in an old ruined temple of a long-forgotten religion? Is the palace full of statues of ancient heroes? 
The same applies to politics. 
Even if you don't describe it in 
detail, it's there, and it might 
affect your characters. You can 
choose to 
go into as much or as little 
detail as you like.. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMWRITING YOUR WORLD’S 
HISTORY 
Are there any important historical rulers whom people often mention? In which context are they mentioned? 
Are any people regarded badly by history? Is this legacy fair? 
Are any significant battles still talked about? Why? 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMWRITING YOUR WORLD’S 
HISTORY 
Are there any famous/fictional in-world lovers that couples commonly get compared to, like this world’s Romeo & Juliet? 
Are any ancient political events still talked about? 
Did a historical event cause any political or racial tensions that affect people to this day? 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMWRITING YOUR WORLD’S

Do any groups view a single historical event very differently? How, and why? 
Do those in power lie about any historical events? Are any historical events taboo or controversial?

HOW TO DESIGN FICTIONAL 
CURRENCY 
Feel free to delete these pages if you don't want to go into this level of detail - you really don't need to unless it's fun for you! 
Materials: A common choice is to make coins from gold, silver, or copper. You can explore materials such as gems, crystals, stones, valuable goods, magic runes, and other materials that the land may value. 
Naming: The name of your currency should align with the cultural and historical context of your world. Refer to your language sheet. 
Common choices for naming coins include taking the names of old real-world currency (crowns, florins, etc.) or creating a new name that reflects the material of your currency (e.g. if gemstones are used as currency, you could measure 
gold/gemstone currency in carats). 
Value: You could choose to include denominations (e.g. 1 pound is worth 100 pennies) but don't let it confuse the reader. 
Some currency value is intuitive (gold > silver > bronze, or diamonds > common gems). 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT
SCHOOLOFPLOT.COM 
COMMON SYMBOLS ON 
CURRENCY 
Feel free to delete these pages if you don't want to go into this level of detail - you really don't need to unless it's fun for you! 
Coins often feature a variety of symbols that hold historical, cultural, or national significance such as: 
Monarch Plantlife Religious Symbol 
Coat of Arms Animal Mythological figure 
This can be a fun way to incorporate some subtle worldbuilding. A character could reach for a coin bearing the face of the monarch, or the kingdom’s treasured animal, leading to a bit of quick, natural exposition.

MAGIC 
SYSTEM
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMHOW TO WRITE 
MAGIC 
If you want to create magic for this world, you have to create rules that the magic must abide by. 
Creative people don't tend to like being restricted, so this idea is often unpopular with new writers. 
However, without rules, the story is easily picked apart and undermined: 
"Well why can't the good guys just snap their fingers and fix everything?" 
Rules are there to make your 
story and world make sense 
to readers, and also to create 
tension. 
Your magic needs limitations for 
your story to be engaging. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMSOFT VS. 
HARD MAGIC 
Soft magic refers to magic systems in 
storytelling characterised by vague, undefined, or unexplained natures. 
The focus is on the narrative and emotional impact of magic. Magic often takes a backseat in stories like this, which tend to be more focused on other aspects. 
Because the magic has very few "rules", it is limited by other factors such as personal reluctance, social taboo, inability, etc. 
Hard magic refers a magic system with well defined rules and limitations. 
Avatar the Last Airbender is often given as an example of an understandable hard magic system (e.g. you know that a waterbender can't control fire). For a literary example, Brandon Sanderson is famous for his hard magic systems. 
Both hard and soft magic systems are great, but hard magic systems may take more planning. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMSOFT VS.

However, these are just guidelines. Don't feel pressure to label your system if you don't want to. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMTYPES OF 
MAGIC 
There are many types of magic systems to choose from, and here are some ideas... 
Elemental Magic: Manipulation and control of the classical elements: fire, water, earth, and air. 
Hereditary Magic: Certain families have magical abilities that are passed down genetically. It may be that one specific skill (e.g. mind 
reading) is inherent to one bloodline, or it can be more random.. 
Incantations: A specific set of words has a specific result (e.g. spoken spells) 
Ritual Magic: Rituals and offerings invoke supernatural beings like demons or fae. This may involve the use of a grimoire. 
Tool-Based Magic: You need an item (wand, staff, amulet, etc.) to perform magic. 
Contagious Magic: If you touch a specific magic item/artefact, you obtain (often soft) magic. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMTYPES OF 
MAGIC 
There are many types of magic systems to choose from, and here are some ideas... 
Celestial Magic: Practitioners draw their power from celestial bodies (stars, moons, planets, etc.) 
Portal Magic: Portals can be created, or normal objects (e.g. mirrors) can be turned into portals by the magic user. 
Gifted Magic: Magic may be gifted by the gods. Your power can be determined by whichever god is your benefactor (e.g. those gifted by the god of love get love powers) 
Energy Magic: Magic defined by types of energy (e.g. light, darkness) which practitioners can manipulate and harness to cast spells, etc. 
Alchemy: Practitioners may create magical elixirs, transmute elements (such as mercury and iron), or use elemental powders. Different elements may possess different properties. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMMAGIC 
Describe the magic used in your world 
What is this magic called, and why? 
Where did the magic originally come from? 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMMAGIC 
Are you born with magic or can you learn it? 
If you need to learn/practice magic, who helps you to do this? (e.g. a school, a mentor, your family) 
Is it desirable to know magic?

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMHOW DO I WRITE 
MAGICAL 
LIMITATIONS? 
Think of a reason why all magic users aren't unstoppable gods. For example: 
Skill: You need to practice very hard to get good. Not everyone is there yet. 
Physics: For example, in Avatar: the Last Airbender, metalbenders (who can 
manipulate metal) can easily break out of a metal cage, so people start trapping them in wooden cages instead. 
Law: In BBC's Merlin, magic is punishable by death. This limits our protagonist, who is constantly forced to hide his powers, or risk being executed. 
Resources: You can’t do magic if you don’t have a specific resource. E.g., Harry 
Potter's wizards are often useless without wands.

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COM
HOW TO CONNECT MAGIC WITH POLITICS 
An interesting thing you may choose to consider incorporating into your 
worldbuilding is how magic influences political structures in your world. 
Those with magical abilities may hold unique positions of influence, or the fear of magic could lead to discrimination and persecution 
.The presence of magic may lead to the establishment of magical institutions such as academies or guilds. These institutions could 
play a role in shaping political ideologies, training leaders, or influencing policy. 
The public's perception of magic and magical users can be wielded as a powerful political tool. Leaders might use their own magic to 
inspire loyalty or fear. Propaganda may shape public opinion regarding the role of magic in society, with magic users being scapegoated.

CULTURE
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMWHAT IS 
CULTURE? 
Culture is an umbrella term that describes the norms and behaviours within a culture. It can involve beliefs, arts, laws, customs, food, and 
habits of the people who live within that culture. 
Culture is often shared by people within the same geographical region, or sometimes religion. Although the people will have different individual tastes, a region tends to have its own traditional foods, music, beliefs, and customs. 
This is a good way to distinguish two 
different locations in your 
story. Consider how 
geography, climate, and 
available resources affect 
the following questions. 
Repeat the questions 
for each different 
culture in your world. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMCULTURE

(e.g. elders, the church...) 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMSHOULD I INVENT A 
LANGUAGE? 
It's not necessary. You can do it if you find it fun, and think it might enrich your world. 
Even if you don't invent a language, you can consider how each language spoken in your world might sound. 
In the real world, you can tell that Grimsby, Kyoto, and Abu Dhabi are in different countries that speak different languages. 
The names of people, places, foods, historical events, and new technologies are likely going to be named based on the language that your characters speak in-universe. 
A quick hack for this is to pick a real language and base your naming traditions on that language. 
You can collect the following data to help inspire your fictional language's sounds... 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COM

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMBASIC WORDS IN YOUR 
LANGUAGE 
If you choose to dig a little deeper, you could invent some words that may crop up more commonly such as:

I love you 
Cheers 
Be quiet 
Sorry

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMTIMEKEEPING 
How do they measure days, hours, months, and years in your world? They might use terms like ‘years’ or ‘months’ but they will likely not use words like Monday or July. 
Here are some ideas of how your world could measure or record time: 
Eclipses 
Tide seasons 
Moon cycle Harvests 
Seasons Holidays 
If your world has no clocks, you could measure time via sundials, clepsydra, or hourglasses. People may use phrases like “midday”,“noon”, “dawn”,“dusk”,“three bells”, etc. 
For those using sundials, specific markings would indicate the passing of hours. People may say things like "it's three marks past midday" or "it's approaching the eighth hour." 
Alternatively you could consider using a generator such as:

@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMCREATING YOUR WORLD'S FASHION 
An easy starting point for creating your world's fashion is to choose a real culture and time period and find a fashion archive of it. These links can be helpful: 
Fashion Timeline Rosalie Gilbert 
History of Fashion Europeana 
But consider what sorts of fabrics and dyes different people might have access to. 
Also consider the functionality of clothes. 
Consider the climate, and 
what that means for 
fabrics and styles. 
Consider the day-to-day 
lives of people in this 
culture, and how that

RELIGION

HOW TO WRITE 
RELIGIONS 
Cultures influence religions just as religions influence culture. The two are connected. 
If the culture is collectivist, how would this be shown in the religion? If the culture is warlike, what sort of gods would they worship? 
You don't have to describe every 
aspect of your culture's religion to 
your reader. But it can be nice to 
get clear on the specifics yourself. 
Religion can have a huge, lasting 
impact on culture, including 
things like language, cuisine, and 
marriage. 
Even "goodbye" comes from a 
1500s contraction of the phrase 
“God be with ye”!

HOW TO CREATE 
FICTIONAL GODS 
First, decide how many gods you want your religion to have. It can be, for example: 
Monotheistic: one god 
Polytheistic: many gods 
Even within polytheistic religions, there can be a hierarchy. Perhaps the lesser gods answer to a king or queen god. Perhaps they are even merely facets of their ruler. 
If your religion is polytheistic, make sure you get the basics down. A lot of real 
religions have gods who rule 
over things like the sun, 
moon, sea, life, death, 
crops/harvest, fertility, etc. 
What do civilisations find 
important? There'll likely 
be a god for that.

HOW TO CREATE 
FICTIONAL GODS 
As we mentioned, the gods your culture worships says a lot about the culture itself. 
You can also consider whether (in nations with polytheistic faiths) different regions can favour different gods. 
For example, in a port town, perhaps they mainly worship their religion's sea god. 
Also consider that not all faiths 
worship gods. There are some 
religions who have a set of beliefs but not a god. For example, they might believe in an afterlife or 
reincarnation, but just not gods. 
Pantheism is another one to consider. This is the belief that the world is 
a god. They see divinity in nature. 
@SCHOOLOFPLOT SCHOOLOFPLOT.COMHOW TO WRITE YOUR WORLD'S 
RELIGIONS 
Let's dig a little deeper and ask some questions to find a suitable religion for your civilisation. 
Describe your civilisation's culture and its values. Is it warlike? Does it value peace? Is it highly individualistic? 
Describe the geography of your civilisation. 
What large natural entities are present? Sea? Woodlands? Mountains? 
How might these two aspects be represented in this culture's religion? 
Remember how a civilisation's values might be reflected in religion. Also think about whether the location's nature/geography might play a part.
