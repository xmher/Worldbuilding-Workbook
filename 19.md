# SECTION 19: World-Romance Integration Worksheet

This is where everything comes together. You've built your world, designed your magic, created your institutions, and checked for consistency and agency. Now it's time to make sure all of these elements are actually serving your romance.

In Section 16, you tested whether your worldbuilding systems connect to each other. This section tests whether they all connect to your love story specifically. Each element of your world should push your characters together, pull them apart, or force them to make hard choices.

If you can't connect a worldbuilding element to the romance, it might not belong in the story.

## The Push-Pull Analysis

For each worldbuilding element, identify whether it pushes characters together, pulls them apart, or both. The best worldbuilding does both — creating connection AND obstacle simultaneously.

### Your Magic System

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System)

**How does magic push them together?**

(Need each other's magic, magical compatibility, shared power, one teaches the other, healing requires touch, bond connects them)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does magic pull them apart?**

(Magic incompatible or dangerous together, using magic requires sacrifice, one's magic makes them hunted, power imbalance, magic reveals secrets that hurt)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your magic do both?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

The strongest integration: Magic creates both bond and barrier.

### Your Political Structure

(Reference: Section 5 — Government, Power & Law)

**How does politics push them together?**

(Alliance requires union, shared political enemy, both serve same ruler, political marriage, diplomatic mission)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does politics pull them apart?**

(Opposing sides, forbidden relationship, duty to different factions, political consequences of being together)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**The political dilemma — what forces them to choose between duty and love?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Your Culture

(Reference: Section 3 — Culture, Customs & Daily Life)

**How does culture push them together?**

(Shared traditions, cultural expectations of partnership, customs that create intimacy, values they both hold)

_______________________________________________________________

**How does culture pull them apart?**

(Different cultures, taboo relationship, cultural expectations they must violate, family/community opposition)

_______________________________________________________________

**The cultural crisis — must they choose between belonging and relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Your Geography

(Reference: Section 1 — Geography & Environment)

**How does geography push them together?**

(Isolated together, dangerous journey requires partnership, shared shelter, limited space)

_______________________________________________________________

**How does geography pull them apart?**

(Physical distance, dangerous territory between them, different homelands, borders that separate)

_______________________________________________________________

**The geographical obstacle they must navigate?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Your Economy

(Reference: Section 4 — Economy, Labor & Resources)

**How does economy push them together?**

(Economic partnership, shared resources, one provides what other needs, economic necessity)

_______________________________________________________________

**How does economy pull them apart?**

(Class difference, economic competition, poverty vs. wealth, debt or obligation)

_______________________________________________________________

**The economic pressure on their relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

## ⭐ The "Why Now?" Test (PRIORITY)

One of the most important questions: Why are they getting together NOW?

**Why couldn't they have gotten together earlier?**

What had to change? What barriers shifted? What brought them into contact?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What specific worldbuilding event kicks off their relationship?**

(Connected to your world: war starts, academy term begins, treaty signed, curse activates, marriage arranged, mission assigned)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the deadline or time pressure?**

(Reference Section 17 — Dual Clock)

Ticking clock, approaching war, seasonal magic, political deadline, curse worsening, limited time before forced separation:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if they don't resolve things by this deadline?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your fantasy deadline align with your romance deadline?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

Ideal: Both resolve at the same climactic moment.

If no, how could you align them?

_______________________________________________________________

## The Power Exchange Analysis

(Reference: Section 18 — Agency Check, Power Dynamic section)

### Mapping Power Shifts

**At the beginning, who has more power?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding element creates this imbalance?**

(Political position, magical ability, wealth, knowledge, physical freedom, social status)

_______________________________________________________________

**Map power at three points:**

| Story Point | Who Has Power | Worldbuilding Reason |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Early story | | |
| Midpoint | | |
| Near end | | |

**Does power shift multiple times?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

If one character is always dominant, relationship may feel unequal.

### The Leverage Question

**What leverage does the "weaker" character hold?**

(Information, skills, emotional insight, ability to leave, something the powerful one needs)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When do they use this leverage?** (Specific scene)

_______________________________________________________________

**By the end, is the power imbalance addressed?**

_______________________________________________________________

## ⭐ The Obstacle Inventory (PRIORITY)

List every major obstacle keeping your characters apart, and trace each to specific worldbuilding.

**Obstacle 1:** ________________________________________________

Worldbuilding source (which section): _______________________________

How they overcome it: ___________________________________________

**Obstacle 2:** ________________________________________________

Worldbuilding source (which section): _______________________________

How they overcome it: ___________________________________________

**Obstacle 3:** ________________________________________________

Worldbuilding source (which section): _______________________________

How they overcome it: ___________________________________________

**Obstacle 4:** ________________________________________________

Worldbuilding source (which section): _______________________________

How they overcome it: ___________________________________________

### The Obstacle Test

**Do obstacles stack?** (Multiple systems reinforce each other)

Example: Their relationship is forbidden by law (Section 5), taboo in both their cultures (Section 3), and would break a magical treaty (Section 10).

_______________________________________________________________

**Do obstacles get genuinely resolved, or just ignored when inconvenient?**

(Reference Section 17 — Consistency Check)

_______________________________________________________________

**Does overcoming obstacles require sacrifice?**

What do they give up or risk to be together?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The Interdependence Check

### What They Need From Each Other

**What does your protagonist need that only the love interest can provide?**

(Connected to worldbuilding: magical ability, political protection, knowledge, access, training, healing, safety)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest need that only the protagonist can provide?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is this need mutual and balanced?** ☐ Yes ☐ One-sided

One-sided need creates power imbalance. Mutual need creates interdependence.

**Does need evolve from practical to emotional?**

Best arc: They need each other for survival (worldbuilding), then discover emotional need (character).

_______________________________________________________________

### The "Stronger Together" Question

**How are they more powerful together than apart?**

(Concrete, tied to worldbuilding: magic combines, cover political weaknesses, complementary skills, shared resources)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Specific example where working together achieves what neither could alone:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## ⭐ The Consequence Map (PRIORITY)

If their relationship has no consequences beyond their feelings, it's not integrated with your world.

### Personal Consequences

**If they choose to be together, what does each lose or risk?**

Protagonist loses/risks: __________________________________________

Love interest loses/risks: _________________________________________

(Should connect to: political power, magical ability, cultural belonging, family, safety, freedom, identity)

### Political Consequences

**If their relationship becomes official/public, what political changes occur?**

(Reference Section 5)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Magical Consequences

**What happens magically when they commit to each other?**

(Reference Section 10)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Social Consequences

**How does their relationship affect others in your world?**

(Reference Section 3)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Ripple Test

**If nothing in your world changes when they get together, worldbuilding and romance aren't integrated.**

What is the larger impact of their relationship beyond themselves?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Emotional Tone Alignment

Your worldbuilding creates atmosphere. Does it match the romance you're writing?

**What emotional tone does your world create?**

(Dark and dangerous? Light and playful? Melancholy? Hopeful? Tense? Lush and sensual? Harsh and gritty?)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What emotional tone does your romance have?**

(Intense and passionate? Sweet and tender? Angsty and painful? Playful and fun? Slow and yearning?)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do these tones complement each other?** ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ They contrast intentionally

Complement: Dark world + intense romance. Light world + playful romance.
Intentional Contrast: Dark world + tender romance (finding softness in harshness).

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your worldbuilding create the right atmosphere for romantic moments?**

Does the setting enhance the mood you want for key scenes?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding elements create romantic atmosphere?**

(Moonlight through magical forests, stolen moments in dangerous courts, survival intimacy in harsh wilderness, luxury and beauty of palace settings)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Pacing Integration

Worldbuilding affects how fast relationships can develop.

**Does your worldbuilding support slow burn or fast fall?**

Slow burn needs: Obstacles that prevent quick resolution, reasons they can't act on attraction, time spent together building tension.

Fast fall needs: Intense circumstances, life-or-death pressure, forced intimacy, "we might die tomorrow" urgency.

What does your world support? _____________________________________

What does your romance require? ___________________________________

**Do they match?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

If no, adjust worldbuilding or romance expectations.

**What worldbuilding elements slow the romance down?**

(Social rules, physical separation, danger that prevents intimacy, secrets that must be revealed slowly, duties that consume time)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding elements speed the romance up?**

(Life-or-death situations, forced proximity, magical bonds, "we might die tomorrow" pressure, isolation together)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Integration Failure Modes

Check if you've fallen into these common traps:

### ☐ The Decorative World

Detailed worldbuilding completely irrelevant to the romance.

**Test:** If you set the romance in a different world entirely, would it play out the same?

Fix needed? ☐ Yes ☐ No

How to fix: ____________________________________________________

### ☐ The Pausing Plot

Fantasy plot stops entirely whenever romance needs a moment.

**Test:** Does external danger remain active during romantic scenes?

(Reference Section 17 — Does the Fantasy Plot Pause)

Fix needed? ☐ Yes ☐ No

How to fix: ____________________________________________________

### ☐ The Arbitrary Obstacle

Obstacles exist because plot needs them, not from established worldbuilding.

**Test:** Can you trace each obstacle to a specific worldbuilding rule established earlier?

Fix needed? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Which obstacles need worldbuilding foundation? _______________________

### ☐ The Disappeared Consequences

Consequences established earlier vanish when characters break rules for romance.

**Test:** Have characters broken established rules without facing stated consequences?

(Reference Section 17 — Consistency Check)

Fix needed? ☐ Yes ☐ No

Which consequences need addressing? _______________________________

### ☐ The Solved World

Problems could easily be solved by established worldbuilding but aren't.

**Test:** Could they use magic/resources/abilities they have to solve their problems?

Fix needed? ☐ Yes ☐ No

How to address: _________________________________________________

## Scene-Level Integration Check

Choose 3-5 important romantic scenes and test whether worldbuilding is essential to each.

### Scene 1: ___________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding element makes this scene possible?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding element creates tension/stakes in this scene?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Could this scene happen in a non-fantasy contemporary setting?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

If yes, worldbuilding isn't essential to this scene — consider how to integrate more deeply.

### Scene 2: ___________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding makes this scene possible?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding creates tension/stakes?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Could this happen in a non-fantasy setting?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

### Scene 3: ___________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding makes this scene possible?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What worldbuilding creates tension/stakes?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Could this happen in a non-fantasy setting?** ☐ Yes ☐ No

## ⭐ The Final Integration Questions (PRIORITY)

### Question 1: The Inseparability Test

**Can you remove the romance and still have a complete fantasy plot?**

☐ Yes → Romantic Fantasy (romance enhances but isn't structurally essential)
☐ No → Fantasy Romance (romance is the structural core)
☐ Partially → True blend (both essential, neither works alone)

All are valid — knowing which helps you prioritize.

**Can you remove the fantasy elements and still have the same romance?**

☐ Yes → Worldbuilding is decorative (problem — needs strengthening)
☐ No → Good (worldbuilding is essential to the romance)

### Question 2: The Climax Integration Test

**At your climax, are fantasy conflict and romance resolved in the same moment?**

☐ Yes → Excellent integration
☐ Close → They resolve in quick sequence at the end
☐ No, separately → Integration needs work

**Describe your climax — how does it resolve both external conflict and relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Question 3: The Transformation Test

**Has the romance changed your world, or just affected two people?**

What has changed in your world because of their relationship?

_______________________________________________________________

## Your Integration Score

Count how many of these are true for your story:

☐ Each major worldbuilding system both pushes them together AND pulls them apart

☐ The timing of the romance is dictated by worldbuilding events (not arbitrary)

☐ Power shifts between characters due to worldbuilding factors

☐ All major obstacles trace to specific worldbuilding systems

☐ Characters need each other for concrete worldbuilding reasons

☐ Their relationship has consequences that ripple through the world

☐ Key romantic scenes require worldbuilding elements to function

☐ The climax resolves both fantasy plot and romance together

☐ The romance changes something in the world beyond the couple

☐ Removing either romance or fantasy elements would break the story

**Score: _____ / 10**

9-10: Excellent integration — romance and world are inseparable
7-8: Strong with specific areas to strengthen
5-6: Moderate — some elements need deeper connection
3-4: Weak — worldbuilding and romance mostly separate
0-2: Romance and fantasy occupy the same book but aren't the same story

---

## Quick Fixes for Low Scores

**If worldbuilding doesn't push AND pull:**
Add a way your magic/politics/culture both creates connection AND creates obstacle. The same element should do both.

**If timing feels arbitrary:**
Tie the start of the romance to a worldbuilding event (war begins, academy term starts, treaty signed, curse activates). Make the "why now" obvious.

**If obstacles are arbitrary:**
Go back and establish the worldbuilding rule that creates each obstacle. If you can't find one, create it — or cut the obstacle.

**If no consequences ripple out:**
Add a scene showing how their union affects others — inspires them, threatens them, changes political calculus, proves something thought impossible.

**If climax doesn't integrate:**
Find a way the relationship is essential to solving the external problem, or the external problem forces the relationship to its resolution. Best: both.

## Final Thought: One Story, Not Two

When someone finishes your book, they shouldn't say "this was a romance set in a fantasy world" or "a fantasy with a romantic subplot."

They should feel that the magic and the love were part of the same story — that you couldn't have one without the other, that the world created the romance and the romance changed the world.

That's integration. That's romantasy.

The world is why they can't be together easily.
The world is why they need each other.
The world is what they change by choosing each other.

Build a world that makes love both impossible and necessary — then let them choose it anyway.
