# SECTION 1: Geography & Environment

Geography isn't just a map — it's one of the biggest influences that shape people and societies. Mountains create borders that become political divisions. Deserts isolate cultures. Rivers determine where cities grow. Control of fertile valleys determines who holds power.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — The physical reality of your world. Terrain, climate, resources, dangers, and how geography shapes where and how people live. This is the geographic baseline that exists regardless of your characters' romantic situation.

**Part Two: Geography & Romance** — How physical geography creates romantic tension. Separation and proximity, dangerous journeys together, entering each other's worlds, places that hold emotional meaning.

You need both.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question will apply to your story. **Skip what doesn't fit.**

**Worldbuild for its own sake if you want.** A richly developed world has value beyond what appears on the page. Use the "romance connection" prompts for brainstorming if they're helpful, or leave them blank if that element is just background texture.

**Come back later.** If you're not sure whether something matters yet, skip it and return once your story has taken more shape.

This workbook is a tool, not a test.

## How to Think About Geography in Romantasy

Geography in romantasy functions as a **physical pressure system** — the physical world can force your characters together, force them apart, or create conditions where they'll have to rely on each other. Before you draw a map, ask yourself: *What geographic situation does my romance need?*

Not every hill and river needs to serve the plot. But the geography you emphasize — the locations where scenes happen, the terrain your characters traverse, or the distances between them — should be doing something. Background geography creates atmosphere and believability, but you can also use geography to push the plot and characters to develop..

### The Geography-as-Friction Framework

Develop geography that creates friction — between your characters, or between what they want and what they can have:

**Separation friction:** What physical obstacles keep them apart?
- Different kingdoms separated by mountains
- An ocean that takes months to cross
- A magical barrier that can only be crossed under certain conditions
- War zones that make travel deadly

**Proximity friction:** What forces them together despite themselves?
- A snowed-in mountain pass
- A ship voyage with no escape
- An isolated estate or academy
- A dangerous journey requiring partnership

**Resource friction:** What geographic scarcity creates conflict?
- Water rights in a desert region
- The only pass through the mountains
- A rare magical resource found in contested territory
- Trade routes that require cooperation between enemies

Geography that doesn't create friction isn't wasted — it's just setting.

### The "Pressure Cooker" Principle

The most effective romantasy settings function as pressure cookers — environments that trap characters together and force interaction:

- **Physical trapping:** Islands, academies, sieges, ships, remote estates
- **Circumstantial trapping:** Dangerous wilderness requiring partnership, diplomatic missions, shared exile
- **Environmental trapping:** Storms, seasons, magical barriers that prevent departure

*If your characters could simply walk away from each other, would they?* If yes, your geography might need to make walking away impossible, dangerous, or costly.

## Common Geographic Patterns in Romantasy

### Settings That Force Proximity

| Setting Type | Why It Works | Examples |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **The Academy/Training Ground** | Characters live, train, and compete in close quarters with no escape | *Fourth Wing*, *Zodiac Academy* |
| **The Isolated Estate** | Limited cast, limited space, limited options for avoidance | Gothic romances, *Pride and Prejudice* variations |
| **The Ship/Caravan** | Moving container with enforced proximity and shared danger | Pirate romance, trade caravan stories |
| **The Siege/War Camp** | External threat forces cooperation; death is the alternative | Military romantasy |
| **The Diplomatic Mission** | Enemies must travel together, represent opposing sides | Arranged marriage journeys |
| **The Wilderness Journey** | Survival requires partnership; dangers reveal character | Quest narratives |

### Geographic Barriers That Create Stakes

| Barrier Type | Romantic Function | Story Possibilities |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Mountain ranges** | Separate nations/cultures; make travel seasonal | Characters from opposite sides; winter trapping |
| **Oceans** | Create complete separation; make departure permanent | Letters across distance; the weight of leaving |
| **Deserts** | Isolate cultures; make resources precious | Oasis politics; survival journeys |
| **Magical borders** | Can be crossed only by certain people or under certain conditions | One character can cross, one cannot |
| **War zones** | Make travel deadly; create no-man's-land between peoples | Enemies from opposing sides |
| **Political borders** | Crossing means treason or exile | Forbidden love across enemy lines |

### Environmental Conditions That Affect Romance

| Condition | How It Creates Pressure | Romantic Beats It Enables |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Harsh winters** | Traps characters indoors; requires shared warmth | Forced proximity; "snowed in" scenarios |
| **Dangerous nights** | Characters must shelter together after dark | Shared watch; protective sleeping arrangements |
| **Seasonal access** | Passes close, ships can't sail, travel becomes impossible | Racing against time; trapped until spring |
| **Resource scarcity** | Sharing becomes necessary; generosity becomes meaningful | Sharing food/water; sacrifice for the other |
| **Magical weather** | Unpredictable; can trap or separate without warning | Sudden proximity; unexpected separation |

## Common Mistakes with Geographic Worldbuilding

### Mistake #1: The Teleporting World

**What it looks like:** Characters travel vast distances with no sense of time passing. A journey that should take weeks happens between chapters with no mention of how they traveled or what dangers they faced.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Distance has no weight. Separation has no stakes. Reunion carries no emotional punch.

**How to fix it:** Establish travel times and stick to them. The journey itself can be where the romance happens.

### Mistake #2: The Convenient Geography

**What it looks like:** Geographic features appear or disappear based on plot needs. A mountain range exists when you need to separate characters but vanishes when they need to reunite.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Readers notice. Stakes that feel fake are stakes that don't matter.

**How to fix it:** Establish your geography early and let it constrain you. Let the physical world create problems you didn't plan for — those problems often generate the best scenes.

### Mistake #3: The Empty Map

**What it looks like:** You have a map with named places, but none feel lived-in. The geography exists but doesn't affect anything.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Geography should create culture, which creates characters, which creates conflict. If your geography doesn't explain why people are the way they are, your world is just a painted backdrop.

**How to fix it:** For every major geographic feature, ask: *How does this shape the people who live here?* Let geography explain cultural difference, which explains why your characters see the world differently.

### Mistake #4: The Consequence-Free Environment

**What it looks like:** Your world has dangerous regions and deadly terrain — but no one suffers consequences from them. Characters trek through the Deadly Wastes and emerge fine.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If danger is all threat and no delivery, readers stop believing in it. And if readers don't believe the world is dangerous, they don't believe your characters need each other to survive it.

**How to fix it:** Let the environment actually hurt people. Show us the consequences — exhaustion, injury, loss. Make survival meaningful.

### Mistake #5: Geography Without Emotional Resonance

**What it looks like:** You describe the setting in detail, but it's all physical — mountains are tall, forests are dense, cities are crowded. None of it connects to how your characters feel.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Setting should be emotional landscape. The place where they first met should feel different than other places. The character's homeland should feel like *home*.

**How to fix it:** Give each major location an emotional quality, and let characters experience it differently. The same castle might feel like prison to one character and sanctuary to another.

## Reference: Travel Times (Fantasy Approximations)

| Mode of Travel | Distance per Day | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Walking (easy terrain) | 15-20 miles | Healthy adult, good weather |
| Walking (difficult terrain) | 8-12 miles | Mountains, forest, desert |
| Horseback (sustainable) | 25-35 miles | Without exhausting the horse |
| Horseback (hard riding) | 50-60 miles | Cannot maintain long-term |
| Changing horses (relay) | 100+ miles | Requires infrastructure |
| Ship (sailing) | 100-150 miles | Dependent on wind and current |
| Carriage/wagon | 20-30 miles | Roads required; slower on rough terrain |

# PART ONE: THE FOUNDATION

---

## The Big Picture: Your World's Scale

**What's the geographic scope of your story?**

Check the scope that best fits your story, then note the primary locations where your romance actually takes place. Even epic-scale worlds usually focus on a handful of key locations.

| Scope | ✓ | Primary Location(s) |
|-------|---|---------------------|
| Single city/location (isolated island, palace, academy) | | |
| Single region (kingdom, province, territory) | | |
| Multiple regions (nations, continents) | | |
| Entire world (epic scope) | | |
| Multiple worlds/realms (parallel dimensions, portals) | | |

**If your world is large, where specifically does your romance happen?**

You don't need to detail everything — just locations that matter.

| Location Type | Name/Description |
|---------------|------------------|
| Primary location | |
| Secondary location | |
| Secondary location | |

---

## Terrain Types

| Terrain | Exists? | Where? | What It Provides | What Challenges It Creates |
|---------|---------|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Mountains | | | | |
| Forests | | | | |
| Deserts | | | | |
| Plains/Grasslands | | | | |
| Wetlands/Swamps | | | | |
| Tundra/Ice | | | | |
| Coastline/Beaches | | | | |
| Islands | | | | |
| Rivers/Lakes | | | | |
| Volcanic regions | | | | |
| Magical/unusual terrain | | | | |

**Which 2-3 terrains matter most for your story?**

Most stories don't use every terrain equally. Identify your priority terrains — the ones worth developing because your characters interact with them directly.

| Priority | Terrain | Why It Matters to Your Story |
|----------|---------|------------------------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |

---

## Resources & Territorial Control

Geography determines who has what — and therefore, who has power. Fertile land, fresh water, mineral deposits, trade routes: these are worth fighting over, worth marrying for, worth dying for.

In romantasy, resource control often creates the power imbalances that drive conflict between love interests. These geographic facts become personal when your characters are on opposite sides of them.

Resource control explains arranged marriages, political alliances, and the economic pressures that force characters into impossible choices.

**What natural resources are geographically concentrated?**

| Resource | Where It's Found | Who Controls It |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Fertile farmland | | |
| Fresh water | | |
| Timber/forests | | |
| Mineral deposits | | |
| Coastal access/ports | | |
| Mountain passes | | |
| Magical resources | | |

**What geographic features give strategic or economic advantage?**

The only pass through the mountains? The river that enables trade? The natural harbor? The defensible high ground?

| Feature | Location | Who Controls It | How They Got Control |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**What geographic resource creates tension or conflict in your world?**

Water rights? Arable land? Access to the sea? Control of a trade route?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does geographic resource control affect your characters?**

Does one character's family/nation control something the other's needs? Is there territorial dispute between their peoples? Does geography explain the power imbalance between them?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The Sensory World

Geography isn't just about what's there — it's about what it feels like to be there.

The sensory details of your setting create the emotional texture of scenes. A first kiss hits differently in a garden heavy with night-blooming jasmine than in a stone corridor that smells of torch smoke. What do your characters see, hear, smell, feel on their skin in the spaces where important moments happen?

If your characters come from different environments, their sensory experiences of "comfort" and "home" will differ. What feels cozy to one might feel suffocating to another.

**What does your primary setting look, sound, smell, and feel like?**

| Sense | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| What you see | |
| What you hear | |
| What you smell | |
| What the air feels like (temperature, humidity, wind) | |

**How does the environment change at different times of day?**

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Morning | |
| Midday | |
| Evening | |
| Night | |

**What's beautiful about this place?**

The moments of wonder, the views that take your breath away:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's harsh or uncomfortable about this place?**

The grit, the difficulty, what wears on people:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the environment affect mood?**

Does the setting feel oppressive? Peaceful? Wild? Claustrophobic? Expansive?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Climate, Weather & Seasons

Weather creates immediate physical conditions that affect what's possible — travel, agriculture, warfare, daily life. Climate shapes the rhythm of life in your world, and that rhythm affects when and how your characters can be together.

Seasons can function as deadlines (they must marry before winter closes the pass), as waiting periods (trapped together until spring thaw), or as markers of time passing in a slow-burn romance. Climate also affects daily intimacy: in hot climates, people come alive at night; in cold climates, they cluster around heat sources; in rainy seasons, they're trapped indoors.

**What's the overall climate?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What seasons exist and how distinct are they?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What season is your story set in?**

The season affects what's possible — travel, festivals, danger, comfort.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Season | |
| What this season makes possible | |
| What this season makes impossible | |

**How do seasons affect life in your world?**

What activities are only possible in certain seasons? What becomes impossible?

| Season | What's Possible | What's Impossible |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Summer/warm season | | |
| Winter/cold season | | |
| Transitional seasons | | |

**Do seasons have cultural or economic significance?**

Planting and harvest? Festival seasons? Trading seasons when passes are clear? Raiding seasons?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the season create pressure or opportunity in your story?**

Racing against winter? Waiting for spring thaw? Only able to travel in summer?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Weather Events

Weather can serve your romance in unexpected ways. A storm that forces two characters to shelter together. A blizzard that delays a departure just long enough. A fog that provides cover for a secret meeting.

Extreme weather raises stakes — characters surviving a dangerous storm together, the vulnerability of being cold or wet or frightened. These moments accelerate emotional intimacy.

**What extreme weather occurs in your world?**

Blizzards? Monsoons? Dust storms? Magical weather?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the worst weather can get?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people prepare for and survive extreme weather?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does extreme weather play a role in your story?**

What happens, and how does it affect your characters' plans or situation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Light and Darkness

When the sun rises and sets affects what's possible — travel, work, danger, rest.

Light and darkness shape romantic opportunity. Darkness provides privacy, cover for secret meetings, the intimacy of being the only two people awake. Daylight is for public performance; nighttime is when masks come off.

In worlds where darkness brings genuine danger — creatures that hunt at night, magic that activates after sundown, cold that kills — characters may be forced into close quarters after dark. Shared watches, sleeping in proximity for safety: these are romance accelerants.

**How many hours of daylight exist in your setting?**

Does this vary by season? Is there magical darkness or eternal light anywhere?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When is it safe to travel or work, and when is it dangerous?**

Are there creatures that hunt at night? Magical dangers after dark? Cold that kills?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do people typically do after dark?**

When travel stops, when work ends — how do people spend evenings?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Shelter & Survival

When the environment is hostile, shelter becomes essential.

Shelter is intimacy compressed. When characters must share limited space — a cave, a single room at an inn, a tent — they lose the ability to maintain distance. They see each other in vulnerable moments: sleeping, waking, sick, injured, afraid.

The quality of shelter matters. A luxurious inn is a different romantic setting than a damp cave. One offers comfort that might lower defenses; the other offers hardship that bonds through shared suffering. Scarcity of shelter raises stakes further — if there's only one safe place, and your characters must share it with enemies or strangers, conflict multiplies.

**What shelter options exist in your world's wilderness?**

| Shelter Type | What's Available |
|--------------|------------------|
| Natural (caves, overhangs, dense forest) | |
| Constructed (inns, waypoints, abandoned buildings) | |
| Improvised (what travelers carry or build) | |

**What happens when shelter is scarce or contested?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment in your story when shelter becomes critical?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| The situation | |
| What shelter they find | |
| What this situation reveals or creates | |

---

## Dangerous Regions

Every world has places that are deadly — and therefore avoided, or crossed only with preparation and company.

Dangerous regions serve romance by raising stakes and forcing partnership. When characters must traverse a deadly wilderness, they depend on each other for survival. The danger strips away social pretense — there's no time for posturing when you're being hunted.

Dangerous regions also function as barriers. Maybe the only route between the characters' homelands runs through territory no one survives alone. Maybe one character is the only guide who knows the safe path.

**What regions are dangerous or forbidden?**

| Region | What Makes It Dangerous | Who Goes There Anyway (and Why) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**What specific dangers exist in wild or unsettled areas?**

| Danger Type | Specifics |
|-------------|-----------|
| Environmental | |
| Creatures | |
| Magical | |
| Human threats (bandits, hostile groups) | |

**Do your characters travel through dangerous territory?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Where and why | |
| What dangers they face | |

---

## Borders & Boundaries

**What geographic features create borders?**

Mountain ranges? Rivers? Oceans? Magical barriers? Deserts?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How permeable are these borders?**

Easy to cross? Heavily guarded? Physically impassable? Seasonally accessible?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters come from opposite sides of a significant border?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What separates them | |
| What crossing means (legally, socially, personally) | |

---

## Displacement & Refugees

Geography creates not just borders but displacement — people driven from their land by war, disaster, or conquest.

**Are there displaced peoples in your world?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who was displaced | |
| From where | |
| Why (war, disaster, persecution, environmental collapse) | |
| Where they went | |

**How are refugees and displaced people treated?**

Welcomed? Tolerated? Exploited? Persecuted?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is either of your characters displaced, a refugee, or descended from displaced people?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which character | |
| What was lost | |
| What they carry from their homeland (objects, memories, traditions) | |
| Do they hope to return? Is return possible? | |

**How does displacement affect their identity and relationships?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

# PART TWO: GEOGRAPHY & ROMANCE

---

## Home & Belonging

Geography isn't just physical — it's emotional. Where do your characters feel they belong? Where do they feel alien?

Home is one of the most emotionally charged concepts in romance. Characters may leave home to find love, may be torn between love and home, may find that home becomes wherever the other person is — or may discover that choosing this person means exile from everything familiar.

The sensory details of home matter because they're the details of identity. What someone considers "home" reveals who they are at their core. When characters share these details, they're sharing something intimate. Someone who has never belonged anywhere brings different needs and fears to a relationship than someone with deep roots.

**Where does your protagonist feel at home?**

The place that shaped them, where they feel most themselves:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does home look, smell, sound like to them?**

The sensory details that mean "home":

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where does your love interest feel at home?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does home mean to them — sensory details?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where does each character feel like an outsider?**

| Character | Where They Feel Alien |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love interest | |

**Do they ever discuss or share what home means to them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Entering Each Other's Worlds

If your characters come from different places, visiting each other's territory is significant.

There's a particular vulnerability in bringing someone into your home territory. You see your world through their eyes, noticing things you'd stopped seeing — both the beauty and the flaws.

For the visitor, entering unfamiliar territory means being the outsider, the one who depends on their partner to navigate. It's a reversal that can shift relationship dynamics. You can't fully know someone until you've seen where they come from.

**Does one character visit the other's home territory?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who visits whose world | |

**What's the sensory experience of entering unfamiliar territory?**

What do they notice first? What's strange? What's beautiful? What's uncomfortable?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the "native" character see their home differently through the visitor's eyes?**

Pride? Shame? New appreciation? Defensiveness?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the visitor respond to this new environment?**

Curiosity? Discomfort? Unexpected delight? Judgment?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the visitor understand about their partner after seeing where they come from?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Travel & Distance

Distance creates stakes. If characters can teleport anywhere, separation has no weight. If journeys take weeks, every departure matters.

**How do people typically travel?**

On foot? Horseback? Ships? Flying creatures? Magical transportation?

_______________________________________________________________

**How long does travel take between key locations?**

| Route | Travel Time |
|-------|-------------|
| From capital to border | |
| From one character's home to the other's | |
| Across the dangerous region | |

**What makes travel difficult or dangerous?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does magic affect travel?**

If teleportation or fast travel exists, who has access? What limits it? Why don't people use it for everything?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters undertake a significant journey?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| From where to where | |
| How long | |
| What happens during the journey | |

---

## Isolated Locations

Some places are cut off from the wider world — by geography, by magic, by choice.

**What isolated locations exist?**

Islands, remote estates, mountain fortresses, ships at sea, academies, pocket dimensions:

| Location | Type | Why People Go | Why Leaving Is Difficult |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Do your characters spend time in an isolated location?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which location | |
| Why they're there | |
| How long | |
| Who else is present | |

**What does isolation create — pressure, intimacy, conflict, or revelation?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Sacred & Significant Locations

Some places carry meaning beyond geography — battlefields, temples, places where history happened.

**What locations are sacred or historically significant?**

| Location | Why It's Significant | Who Controls It |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**Do your characters visit a significant location?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which one | |
| Why they go | |
| What happens there | |

**Does geography hold memory in your world?**

Do battlefields feel haunted? Do sacred groves hold power? Does land remember?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Cities & Settlements

**What major settlements exist?**

| Settlement | Size/Type | Known For | Why It's Located Here (geographic advantage) |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Where do your characters spend most of their time?**

| Character | Primary Location |
|-----------|------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love interest | |

**Does urban vs. rural matter for your characters?**

Different worldviews? Different comfort zones? Class associations?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magical Geography

**Does magic create or alter geography?**

Floating islands? Magically sustained forests? Regions where magic fails? Portals? Blighted lands?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there regions where magic is stronger or weaker?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Where magic is strong (and why) | |
| Where magic is weak (and why) | |

**How does magical geography affect your characters?**

Does one lose power in certain places? Must they travel to a magical location? Are there places they can't go?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Geography as Emotional Landscape

The physical world can resonate with or contrast against the emotional journey — though this works best when it emerges naturally rather than being engineered.

A love scene in a sunlit meadow feels different than one in a crumbling tower. A confession during a storm carries different weight than one in stillness. You don't need to engineer pathetic fallacy, but be intentional about the emotional texture of your key locations.

A single location can feel different depending on circumstances. The same palace might feel magical during a ball and suffocating during captivity. As your characters' relationship changes, the settings might feel different even when the physical reality is the same.

**What's the emotional quality of your primary setting?**

Does it feel oppressive, expansive, peaceful, threatening, beautiful, decaying?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the environment shift over the course of your story?**

Do characters move from one type of landscape to another? Does the same place feel different as circumstances change?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a location that becomes meaningful to your characters specifically?**

A place they return to, a place where something changed, a place that's "theirs":

## Integration Check

| Question | Answer | Example (ACOTAR) |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| How does geography explain cultural differences (from Section 3)? | | *Each Court's territory shapes its people: Spring Court's eternal bloom creates beauty-focused culture; Night Court's mountains and stars foster secretive, cerebral society* |
| How does geography create or reinforce power structures (from Section 5)? | | *High Lords control their territories absolutely; the Wall creates a hard political boundary between fae and human governance* |
| How does geography interact with magic (from Part 1)? | | *Each Court's magic is tied to its land — Spring magic is growth and renewal; Night magic is darkness and stars. Power weakens outside one's territory* |
| What geographic resource or territory is contested in your world? | | *The mortal lands beyond the Wall — Hybern wants to conquer them; some fae want to protect them; humans just want to survive* |

---

## Quick Reference: Geographic Stakes

| Element | Your World | Example (ACOTAR-style) |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| Key location 1 | | *The Spring Court manor — a grand estate surrounded by gardens, where Feyre is both captive and guest* |
| Key location 2 | | *The Wall — the magical barrier separating the mortal lands from faerie* |
| Key location 3 | | *Under the Mountain — Amarantha's dark court, site of climactic confrontation* |
| Key location 4 | | *The mortal village — Feyre's impoverished home, what she left behind* |
| Key location 5 | | *The Night Court — a place of stars and darkness, initially frightening, later sanctuary* |
| The contested resource or territory | | *The seven High Lord territories, each controlling different types of magic and land* |
| The barrier separating peoples or characters | | *The Wall prevents humans from entering faerie (without consequence) and keeps fae from crossing south* |
| The dangerous region | | *Under the Mountain — a place of trials, corruption, and enslavement* |
| The isolated location | | *The Spring Court manor — Feyre is the only human, can't leave, surrounded by fae* |
| The significant journey (from → to) | | *Mortal lands → Spring Court (captivity) → Under the Mountain (trial) → Night Court (transformation)* |
| The place that matters emotionally | | *The manor's art gallery — where Feyre finds purpose and connection through painting* |

---

## Final Thought: Geography Is Story Made Physical

Your map isn't just where things are — it's why characters must make the choices they make. The mountain range is why two nations distrust each other. The desert is why whoever controls the oasis controls the trade route.

Build geography that explains your world and creates the situations your story needs.
