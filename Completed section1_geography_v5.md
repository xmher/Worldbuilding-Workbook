# SECTION 1: Geography & Environment

Geography isn't just a map — it's the physical constraints that shape everything else. Mountains create borders that become political divisions. Deserts isolate cultures. Rivers determine where cities grow. Control of fertile valleys determines who holds power.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — The physical reality of your world. Terrain, climate, resources, dangers, and how geography shapes where and how people live. This is the geographic baseline that exists regardless of your characters' romantic situation.

**Part Two: Geography & Romance** — How physical geography creates romantic tension. Separation and proximity, dangerous journeys together, entering each other's worlds, places that hold emotional meaning.

You need both.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question in this workbook will apply to your story — and that's completely fine. Skip what doesn't fit.

Worldbuild for its own sake if you want. A richly developed world has value beyond what appears on the page. Use the "romance connection" prompts for brainstorming if they're helpful, or leave them blank if that element is just background texture.

Come back later. If you're not sure whether something matters yet, skip it and return once your story has taken more shape.

This workbook is a tool, not a test.

## How to Think About Geography in Romantasy

Geography in romantasy works like a pressure system. The physical world can compress your characters together, force them apart, or create conditions where they have no choice but to rely on each other.

Before you draw a map, ask yourself: What geographic situation does my romance need?

Not every hill and river needs to serve the plot, and that's okay. But the geography you choose to emphasise should be doing something. Think about the locations where your scenes happen, the terrain your characters travel through, and the distances between them.

Background geography creates atmosphere and believability. Foreground geography creates story.

### The Geography-as-Friction Framework

A useful way to think about your world's geography is to develop it around friction. This could be friction between your characters, or between what they want and what they can have.

**Separation Friction**

What physical obstacles keep them apart?

- Different kingdoms separated by mountains
- An ocean that takes months to cross
- A magical barrier that can only be crossed under certain conditions
- War zones that make travel deadly

**Proximity Friction**

What forces them together despite themselves?

- A snowed-in mountain pass
- A ship voyage with no escape
- An isolated estate or academy
- A dangerous journey requiring partnership

**Resource Friction**

What geographic scarcity creates conflict?

- Water rights in a desert region
- The only pass through the mountains
- A rare magical resource found in contested territory
- Trade routes that require cooperation between enemies

Geography that doesn't create friction isn't wasted. It's just setting.

### The "Pressure Cooker" Principle

Some of the most effective romantasy settings work as pressure cookers. These are environments that trap characters together and force interaction. The key is that leaving must be impossible, dangerous, or carry consequences they're not willing to accept.

When characters can't escape each other, they're forced to confront conflict instead of avoiding it, rely on each other despite distrust, and share space long enough for attraction to build beneath their defences.

Here are some ways you can make the container seal tight:

- **Physical trapping:** Islands, academies, sieges, ships, and remote estates. These are locations with literal boundaries characters can't cross.
- **Circumstantial trapping:** Dangerous wilderness requiring partnership, diplomatic missions, and shared exile. In these situations, separating means failure or death.
- **Environmental trapping:** Storms, seasons, and magical barriers that prevent departure. These are external forces that make leaving impossible regardless of desire.
- **Social/political trapping:** Arranged marriages, hostage situations, and court obligations. In these circumstances, leaving would destroy reputation, alliance, or lives.

The pressure cooker works because proximity breeds intimacy. Characters see each other at their worst. They can't keep up facades. Small moments accumulate. Shared meals, overheard conversations, accidental touches in tight quarters. The setting does half the work of bringing them together.

### The Key Question

If your characters could simply walk away from each other, would they? If yes, your geography might need to make walking away impossible, dangerous, or costly.

## Common Geographic Patterns in Romantasy

### Settings That Force Proximity

| Setting Type | Why It Works | Examples |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **The Academy/Training Ground** | Characters live, train, and compete in close quarters with no escape | *Fourth Wing*, *Zodiac Academy* |
| **The Isolated Estate** | Limited cast, limited space, limited options for avoidance | Gothic romances, *Pride and Prejudice* variations |
| **The Ship/Caravan** | Moving container with enforced proximity and shared danger | Pirate romance, trade caravan stories |
| **The Siege/War Camp** | External threat forces cooperation; death is the alternative | Military romantasy |
| **The Diplomatic Mission** | Enemies must travel together, represent opposing sides | Arranged marriage journeys |
| **The Wilderness Journey** | Survival requires partnership; dangers reveal character | Quest narratives |

### Geographic Barriers That Create Stakes

| Barrier Type | Romantic Function | Story Possibilities |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Mountain ranges** | Separate nations/cultures; make travel seasonal | Characters from opposite sides; winter trapping |
| **Oceans** | Create complete separation; make departure permanent | Letters across distance; the weight of leaving |
| **Deserts** | Isolate cultures; make resources precious | Oasis politics; survival journeys |
| **Magical borders** | Can be crossed only by certain people or under certain conditions | One character can cross, one cannot |
| **War zones** | Make travel deadly; create no-man's-land between peoples | Enemies from opposing sides |
| **Political borders** | Crossing means treason or exile | Forbidden love across enemy lines |

### Environmental Conditions That Affect Romance

| Condition | How It Creates Pressure | Romantic Beats It Enables |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Harsh winters** | Traps characters indoors; requires shared warmth | Forced proximity; "snowed in" scenarios |
| **Dangerous nights** | Characters must shelter together after dark | Shared watch; protective sleeping arrangements |
| **Seasonal access** | Passes close, ships can't sail, travel becomes impossible | Racing against time; trapped until spring |
| **Resource scarcity** | Sharing becomes necessary; generosity becomes meaningful | Sharing food/water; sacrifice for the other |
| **Magical weather** | Unpredictable; can trap or separate without warning | Sudden proximity; unexpected separation |

## Common Mistakes with Geographic Worldbuilding

### Mistake #1: The Teleporting World

**What it looks like:** Characters travel vast distances with no sense of time passing. A journey that should take weeks happens between chapters with no mention of how they traveled or what dangers they faced.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Distance has no weight. Separation has no stakes. Reunion carries no emotional punch.

**How to fix it:** Establish travel times and stick to them. The journey itself can be where the romance happens.

### Mistake #2: The Convenient Geography

**What it looks like:** Geographic features appear or disappear based on plot needs. A mountain range exists when you need to separate characters but vanishes when they need to reunite.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Readers notice. Stakes that feel fake are stakes that don't matter.

**How to fix it:** Establish your geography early and let it constrain you. Let the physical world create problems you didn't plan for — those problems often generate the best scenes.

### Mistake #3: The Empty Map

**What it looks like:** You have a map with named places, but none feel lived-in. The geography exists but doesn't affect anything.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Geography should create culture, which creates characters, which creates conflict. If your geography doesn't explain why people are the way they are, your world is just a painted backdrop.

**How to fix it:** For every major geographic feature, ask: *How does this shape the people who live here?* Let geography explain cultural difference, which explains why your characters see the world differently.

### Mistake #4: The Consequence-Free Environment

**What it looks like:** Your world has dangerous regions and deadly terrain — but no one suffers consequences from them. Characters trek through the Deadly Wastes and emerge fine.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If danger is all threat and no delivery, readers stop believing in it. And if readers don't believe the world is dangerous, they don't believe your characters need each other to survive it.

**How to fix it:** Let the environment actually hurt people. Show us the consequences — exhaustion, injury, loss. Make survival meaningful.

### Mistake #5: Geography Without Emotional Resonance

**What it looks like:** You describe the setting in detail, but it's all physical — mountains are tall, forests are dense, cities are crowded. None of it connects to how your characters feel.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Setting should be emotional landscape. The place where they first met should feel different than other places. The character's homeland should feel like *home*.

**How to fix it:** Give each major location an emotional quality, and let characters experience it differently. The same castle might feel like prison to one character and sanctuary to another.

## Reference: Travel Times (Fantasy Approximations)

| Mode of Travel | Distance per Day | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Walking (easy terrain) | 15-20 miles | Healthy adult, good weather |
| Walking (difficult terrain) | 8-12 miles | Mountains, forest, desert |
| Horseback (sustainable) | 25-35 miles | Without exhausting the horse |
| Horseback (hard riding) | 50-60 miles | Cannot maintain long-term |
| Changing horses (relay) | 100+ miles | Requires infrastructure |
| Ship (sailing) | 100-150 miles | Dependent on wind and current |
| Carriage/wagon | 20-30 miles | Roads required; slower on rough terrain |

## The Big Picture: Your World's Scale

Geography is the skeleton of your world. Before you name a single kingdom or draw a single border, it helps to know how big the stage is. As such, there's a significant difference in terms of setting a romantic story that spans an entire continent and one confined to a single city with walls. The distances between characters, the cost of travel, and the possibility of escape or reunion are all shaped by scale.

Try to let geography do emotional work, too. Distance isn't just miles. It's the ache of separation, the danger of the journey, and the question of whether reunion is even possible. A mountain range between two lovers is a different kind of obstacle than a locked door, but both force the same question: how far will you go?

A good starting point is to ground your world's scale in what your characters can see, walk, and survive. If your protagonist has never left her village, the next town over might as well be another planet.

**What's the geographic scope of your story?**

Check the scope that best fits your story, then note the primary locations where your romance actually takes place. Even epic-scale worlds usually focus on a handful of key locations.

| Scope | ✓ | Primary Location(s) |
|-------|---|---------------------|
| Single city/location (isolated island, palace, academy) | | |
| Single region (kingdom, province, territory) | | |
| Multiple regions (nations, continents) | | |
| Entire world (epic scope) | | |
| Multiple worlds/realms (parallel dimensions, portals) | | |

**If your world is large, where specifically does your romance happen?**

You don't need to detail everything — just locations that matter.

| Location Type | Name/Description |
|---------------|------------------|
| Primary location | |
| Secondary location | |
| Secondary location | |

## Naming Places

Place names do a surprising amount of worldbuilding work. A name like "Ashenmere" tells readers something different than "Goldport" before you've described either place. The right names make your world feel cohesive and grounded, even if readers can't quite explain why.

In the real world, most place names started out as descriptions. They told people what was there (a river, a hill, a forest), who lived there, or what happened there. Over time, languages shifted and the meanings got buried. That's why we don't think of "Oxford" as "the place where oxen ford the river" even though that's exactly what it means.

You can use this same logic when naming locations in your world. Think about who named the place and what mattered to them. A farming settlement might be named for the land. A fortress might be named for the family who built it. A holy site might carry the name of a god. If your world has multiple cultures or languages, places might have different names depending on who's talking about them, which is a small detail that can add a lot of texture.

### Finding Your World's Naming Patterns

If you want your place names to feel like they belong to a specific culture or language family, a bit of research goes a long way:

- Pick a real-world language that matches the sound you're going for. Look up common place name elements in that language. What prefixes and suffixes keep appearing? What sounds feel characteristic?
- Study how real names are built. Most are compounds. A word for a landscape feature (river, hill, field) combined with a descriptor (colour, size, a person's name). Once you spot the pattern, you can build your own.
- Behindthename.com has a useful place names section if you want to browse etymologies for inspiration.
- Keep it pronounceable. If your reader stumbles every time they hit a place name, it pulls them out of the story. Read your names aloud. If you can't say it comfortably, your reader won't be able to either.

Don't feel pressured to make every name meaningful, though. Sometimes a name just needs to sound right for the world. If the etymology is enriching your story, great. If it's slowing you down, move on and come back to it later.

---

## Kingdoms & Nations Overview

If your world has multiple kingdoms or nations, this table can help you keep track of them at a glance.

You don't need to fill in every field. Just jot down what you know right now. Maybe you only have a name and a climate so far, and that's perfectly fine. You can always come back later as your story takes shape.

---

## Terrain Types

Not every terrain in your world needs equal development. Your world might include mountains, forests, deserts, plains, wetlands, coastlines, islands, rivers, tundra, or even magical and unusual terrain. That said, consider focusing on the two or three that actually matter for your story. These are the ones your characters traverse, fight over, or call home.

| Terrain | Exists? | Where? | What It Provides | What Challenges It Creates |
|---------|---------|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Mountains | | | | |
| Forests | | | | |
| Deserts | | | | |
| Plains/Grasslands | | | | |
| Wetlands/Swamps | | | | |
| Tundra/Ice | | | | |
| Coastline/Beaches | | | | |
| Islands | | | | |
| Rivers/Lakes | | | | |
| Volcanic regions | | | | |
| Magical/unusual terrain | | | | |

**Which 2-3 terrains matter most for your story?**

Most stories don't use every terrain equally. Identify your priority terrains — the ones worth developing because your characters interact with them directly.

| Priority | Terrain | Why It Matters to Your Story |
|----------|---------|------------------------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |

## Resources & Territorial Control

Who controls the land is what determines who gets what, and therefore, who has the most power. Fertile land, fresh water, mineral deposits, and trade routes are all things worth fighting over, worth marrying for, and worth dying for.

Resource control has great potential in romantasy because it could be used to create an imbalance of power between the love interest(s) and drive the inciting conflict between them. It's also a believable way to explain arranged marriages, political alliances, or economic pressures that force characters into impossible choices.

Rather than explaining resource conflict through exposition, try showing it through what characters can and can't do. For example, a character from a region with limited water availability may cringe while watching someone run their bathtub. Someone from contested territory might notice strategic value in a landscape that others see as beautiful. You can let resource awareness emerge through small reactions, casual comments about price or scarcity, and the background hum of what everyone in this world worries about.

When two characters come from opposite sides of a resource conflict, the tension often shows itself in what they assume about each other, what they're careful not to say, and the moments when privilege becomes visible.

### Real-World Inspiration

Resources have always shaped conflict. Oil drives wars and political alliances. Water rights spark disputes between nations sharing rivers. Spices once fuelled colonial expansion. Salt was taxed so heavily it caused revolutions. Diamonds fund civil wars. Rare earth minerals create modern tech dependencies.

What resource in your world holds this kind of power?

**What natural resources are geographically concentrated?**

| Resource | Where It's Found | Who Controls It |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Fertile farmland | | |
| Fresh water | | |
| Timber/forests | | |
| Mineral deposits | | |
| Coastal access/ports | | |
| Mountain passes | | |
| Magical resources | | |

**What geographic features give strategic or economic advantage?**

The only pass through the mountains? The river that enables trade? The natural harbor? The defensible high ground?

| Feature | Location | Who Controls It | How They Got Control |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**What geographic resource creates tension or conflict in your world?**

Water rights? Arable land? Access to the sea? Control of a trade route?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does geographic resource control affect your characters?**

Does one character's family/nation control something the other's needs? Is there territorial dispute between their peoples? Does geography explain the power imbalance between them?

## Describing Your Setting

Geography isn't just about what's there. It's about what it feels like to be there. Think of a first kiss scene: if it occurs in a garden full of blooming jasmine, it will feel different from a first kiss that happens in a stone corridor with a torch-smoke odour. Readers should be able to feel the grit of sand, the dampness of a cave, the sweltering heat of a forge.

One of the most powerful elements you can utilise is filtering sensory detail through your POV character's emotional state. A person who is in love notices the warmth of sunlight, the sweetness of blossoms, and the softness of grass. That same garden, to a grieving character, might feel too bright, the flowers cloying, the birdsong intrusive. Of course, you shouldn't describe every tiny detail. We've all tried reading a book where every tiny detail was painstakingly descriptive to the point you didn't even know what the point of the scene was. To prevent this, I'd choose two or three sensory details for each scene that reinforce the atmosphere you are trying to create.

It also helps to avoid the "weather report" opening, where a scene begins with a neutral description of the setting. Instead, try integrating sensory details into action and emotion. Rather than writing "The room was cold," you could write something like "She pulled her cloak tighter, breath misting in the unheated chamber." When your character interacts with the environment, it reveals both setting and feeling at the same time.

**What does your primary setting look, sound, smell, and feel like?**

| Sense | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| What you see | |
| What you hear | |
| What you smell | |
| What the air feels like (temperature, humidity, wind) | |

**How does the environment change at different times of day?**

| Time | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Morning | |
| Midday | |
| Evening | |
| Night | |

**What's beautiful about this place?**

The moments of wonder, the views that take your breath away:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's harsh or uncomfortable about this place?**

The grit, the difficulty, what wears on people:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the environment affect mood?**

Does the setting feel oppressive? Peaceful? Wild? Claustrophobic? Expansive?

_______________________________________________________________

## Climate, Weather & Seasons

Weather creates immediate physical conditions that affect what's possible, from travel and agriculture to warfare and daily life. Seasons are particularly great at pushing your story forward. For example, they can create deadlines (e.g., they have to get married by the first spring shower), waiting periods (people are stuck together until spring thaws the roads), or markers of time passing in a slow-burn romance.

A good rule to remember is that seasons are a great indirect way to show time passing. Conversely, you can use weather to create immediate physical danger or discomfort. Make your character sopping wet, or so cold they have no other option BUT to cuddle with their love interest. Oh the things we'll put our protagonists through!

Seasons can mirror emotional shifts, too. A relationship that thaws as winter ends, tension that builds with summer heat, a reckoning that arrives with autumn.

**What's the overall climate?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What seasons exist and how distinct are they?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What season is your story set in?**

The season affects what's possible — travel, festivals, danger, comfort.

| Season | What's Possible | What's Impossible |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Summer/warm season | | |
| Winter/cold season | | |
| Transitional seasons | | |

**Do seasons have cultural or economic significance?**

Planting and harvest? Festival seasons? Trading seasons when passes are clear? Raiding seasons?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the season create pressure or opportunity in your story?**

Racing against winter? Waiting for spring thaw? Only able to travel in summer?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Weather Events

Weather can serve your romance in unexpected ways. A storm that forces two characters to shelter together. A blizzard that delays a departure just long enough. A fog that provides cover for a secret meeting.

Extreme weather raises stakes — characters surviving a dangerous storm together, the vulnerability of being cold or wet or frightened. These moments accelerate emotional intimacy.

**What extreme weather occurs in your world?**

Blizzards? Monsoons? Dust storms? Magical weather?

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the worst weather can get?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people prepare for and survive extreme weather?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does extreme weather play a role in your story?**

What happens, and how does it affect your characters' plans or situation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Light and Darkness

When the sun rises and sets affects what's possible — travel, work, danger, rest.

Light and darkness shape romantic opportunity. Darkness provides privacy, cover for secret meetings, the intimacy of being the only two people awake. Daylight is for public performance; nighttime is when masks come off.

In worlds where darkness brings genuine danger — creatures that hunt at night, magic that activates after sundown, cold that kills — characters may be forced into close quarters after dark. Shared watches, sleeping in proximity for safety: these are romance accelerants.

**How many hours of daylight exist in your setting?**

Does this vary by season? Is there magical darkness or eternal light anywhere?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When is it safe to travel or work, and when is it dangerous?**

Are there creatures that hunt at night? Magical dangers after dark? Cold that kills?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do people typically do after dark?**

When travel stops, when work ends — how do people spend evenings?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Shelter & Survival

When the environment is hostile, shelter becomes essential.

Shelter is intimacy compressed. When characters must share limited space — a cave, a single room at an inn, a tent — they lose the ability to maintain distance. They see each other in vulnerable moments: sleeping, waking, sick, injured, afraid.

The quality of shelter matters. A luxurious inn is a different romantic setting than a damp cave. One offers comfort that might lower defenses; the other offers hardship that bonds through shared suffering. Scarcity of shelter raises stakes further — if there's only one safe place, and your characters must share it with enemies or strangers, conflict multiplies.

**What shelter options exist in your world's wilderness?**

| Shelter Type | What's Available |
|--------------|------------------|
| Natural (caves, overhangs, dense forest) | |
| Constructed (inns, waypoints, abandoned buildings) | |
| Improvised (what travelers carry or build) | |

**What happens when shelter is scarce or contested?**

## Dangerous Regions

Every world has places that are deadly, and therefore avoided, or crossed only with preparation and company. Danger can add to the romance of the journey in several ways though because it can raise stakes and force partnership. Survival requires cooperation. Cooperation requires trust. And trust requires vulnerability.

The most common mistake with dangerous regions is telling readers it's deadly without actually showing it. Characters warn that "no one survives the Thornwood," yet your protagonists stroll through unscathed. To make the danger feel real, you have to show the consequences. Let someone in your party get gravely ill or injured because someone made a bad judgement call. When your characters emerge on the other side, they should be changed. Exhausted, wounded, and closer than before. The journey through danger is where walls come down.

**What regions are dangerous or forbidden?**

| Region | What Makes It Dangerous | Who Goes There Anyway (and Why) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**What specific dangers exist in wild or unsettled areas?**

| Danger Type | Specifics |
|-------------|-----------|
| Environmental | |
| Creatures | |
| Magical | |
| Human threats (bandits, hostile groups) | |

**Do your characters travel through dangerous territory?**

## Borders & Boundaries

Borders are boundaries, and boundaries create conflict. Every border in your world is a line that someone drew or that nature carved, and every line comes with rules about who can cross it and what it costs when they do.

In romantasy, borders serve as obstacles at their most fundamental level. A river between warring kingdoms means your characters were never supposed to meet. A magical barrier means every stolen moment on the wrong side carries real consequences. A closed mountain road means if your characters choose one another then they will both be exiled.

**What geographic features create borders?**

Mountain ranges? Rivers? Oceans? Magical barriers? Deserts?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How permeable are these borders?**

Easy to cross? Heavily guarded? Physically impassable? Seasonally accessible?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters come from opposite sides of a significant border?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What separates them | |
| What crossing means (legally, socially, personally) | |

## Displacement & Refugees

Geography creates not just borders but displacement — people driven from their land by war, disaster, or conquest.

**Are there displaced peoples in your world?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who was displaced | |
| From where | |
| Why (war, disaster, persecution, environmental collapse) | |
| Where they went | |

**How are refugees and displaced people treated?**

Welcomed? Tolerated? Exploited? Persecuted?

**Is either of your characters displaced, a refugee, or descended from displaced people?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which character | |

| What they carry from their homeland (objects, memories, traditions) | |
| Do they hope to return? Is return possible? | |

**How does displacement affect their identity and relationships?**

# Section 1 · Part Two — Geography & Romance

---

## Home & Belonging

Geography isn't just about land; it's also about emotion. The concept of home has to be one of the most emotionally laden ideas in romance. A character may travel away from home to find love, or have to choose between the person they love and returning home. They may find that no matter where they are, home is always where the other person is, or they may discover that choosing this person means being exiled from all that is familiar.

Instead of simply stating a location is important to your character, try to show home through sensory details. What do your characters reach for when they are feeling homesick? What scent immediately takes them back? When writing scenes set in a character's home territory, allow them to move easily and comfortably throughout the space. They should know which floorboards creak, which windows stick. Then compare this to how they move through unfamiliar spaces; hesitantly, cautiously, slightly off-balance.

The conflict between "where I am meant to be" and "where love is leading me" creates some of romance's greatest emotional moments. A character deciding to remain in their lover's world, or asking their lover to come into their own world, is a declaration of equal significance as any verbal confession of love.

**Where does your protagonist feel at home?**

## Entering Each Other's Worlds

If your main characters are from different places, then travelling to visit each other is important; there's a special vulnerability in inviting someone into your home. Your own world becomes visible to you through the visitor's eyes; you begin to notice again what you have been ignoring, including the beauty as well as the flaws.

When a character enters their love interest's world, try filtering every observation through their outsider perspective. What confuses them? What impresses them? What makes them uncomfortable? Their reactions can reveal both the world and the character at once.

The "native" character, meanwhile, experiences a different kind of vulnerability. Suddenly, they're aware of poverty they've normalised, privilege they never thought about, or customs that seemed perfectly reasonable until someone else explained them out loud.

Write the small moments. The love interest automatically reaching to help with something the visitor doesn't know how to do. The visitor mispronouncing a word everyone here knows. The native defending their home against a criticism they privately agree with. These fish-out-of-water scenes create closeness because they need explanations, patience, and the courage to look silly in front of someone you care about.

## Travel & Distance

Distance creates stakes. If your characters can teleport anywhere, separation carries no weight, but if journeys take weeks on horseback, every departure matters and every reunion is earned.

Travel also forces shared vulnerability in ways that daily life doesn't. There's something about tending each other's blisters, sharing warmth on a cold night, and having nowhere to retreat to that bonds people faster than months of safe, comfortable interaction. And when your characters are apart, you can make that distance felt through the details: letters that arrive too late, the agony of not knowing whether someone is safe, and the slow stretch of days without word.

**How do people typically travel?**

## Isolated Locations

Forcing characters to share a space will help to drive their relationship forward faster than if they were able to come and go as they please. The more opportunities your characters are given to get away from one another, the longer it will take for them to have to confront the fact that they need to communicate or compromise. Isolated settings force confrontation, require cooperation, and create the kind of pressure that transforms reluctant attraction into something undeniable.

It helps to establish early on why leaving isn't an option, and to make that reason feel real and insurmountable. In A Court of Mist and Fury, the bargain Feyre struck Under the Mountain means she owes Rhysand a week of her time each month. She has no way out; she can't get to him earlier than agreed. This is what writers call "forced proximity", and it's an amazing way to make characters share a space.

As a result, you can plan ahead to utilise the confines of the space to your advantage. Consider what rooms are used most by all of the characters, how small the hallways are, and what common resources (food, water, etc.) will require collaboration. Also, be sure to write the sense of confinement and the developing intimacy together. Even though characters may find themselves attracted to one another, many times they will still feel trapped or resentful of being forced to live in such close proximity to one another.

Have fun with this plot device and find interesting ways to use the setting to make your characters interact! On a ship, there's nowhere to go after an argument, so you're eating breakfast together whether you like it or not. At an academy, the professor keeps pairing them for sparring practice. In a snowed-in estate, someone has to share a bed because the guest wing is freezing. The setting should be generating its own little problems. Let it do some of the storytelling work for you.

Also, remember that when characters have the ability to leave and instead choose to remain, their decision is a statement.

**What isolated locations exist?**

Islands, remote estates, mountain fortresses, ships at sea, academies, pocket dimensions:

## Places with Meaning

The environment in which your characters live can help to reinforce their feelings or act as an obstacle to them. A love scene in a sunny field will have a totally different effect than one in a crumbling building. A confession in a storm has a much greater impact than one made in complete silence.

You can do this intentionally. Set the mood for your characters' emotions by using sunny weather for happy moments and storms for confrontational moments, or do the opposite. A kiss in a dangerous situation has urgency, while a kiss in a serene garden appears to be an intentional choice.

Pathetic fallacy (when the environment takes on the characteristics of a character) can be helpful when used sparingly. A storm during a fight scene, or the sun breaking through the clouds as two people are making amends. These add to the scene without yelling "SYMBOLISM" at the reader.

You can also illustrate how your characters view the world based on their emotional state. Someone who is in love sees beauty in everything. Someone who is grieving looks at the exact same landscape and sees nothing but desolation. It's a simple aspect of storytelling, but it accomplishes a great deal.

Furthermore, give your characters "their place." A location that becomes special to the relationship, possibly where they first met, had their first kiss, or survived something terrible together. When the characters return to that place later in the story, you don't need to explain why it's significant. The reader should already feel it. A line like "She hadn't returned to the bridge since that night" can be very powerful, but only if you've established that connection earlier.

**What's the emotional quality of your primary setting?**

Does it feel oppressive, expansive, peaceful, threatening, beautiful, decaying?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the environment shift over the course of your story?**

Do characters move from one type of landscape to another? Does the same place feel different as circumstances change?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a location that becomes meaningful to your characters specifically?**

A place they return to, a place where something changed, a place that's "theirs":

## Integration Check

| Question | Answer | Example (ACOTAR) |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| How does geography explain cultural differences (from Section 3)? | | *Each Court's territory shapes its people: Spring Court's eternal bloom creates beauty-focused culture; Night Court's mountains and stars foster secretive, cerebral society* |
| How does geography create or reinforce power structures (from Section 5)? | | *High Lords control their territories absolutely; the Wall creates a hard political boundary between fae and human governance* |
| How does geography interact with magic (from Part 1)? | | *Each Court's magic is tied to its land — Spring magic is growth and renewal; Night magic is darkness and stars. Power weakens outside one's territory* |
| What geographic resource or territory is contested in your world? | | *The mortal lands beyond the Wall — Hybern wants to conquer them; some fae want to protect them; humans just want to survive* |

## Quick Reference: Geographic Stakes

| Element | Your World | Example (ACOTAR-style) |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| Key location 1 | | *The Spring Court manor — a grand estate surrounded by gardens, where Feyre is both captive and guest* |
| Key location 2 | | *The Wall — the magical barrier separating the mortal lands from faerie* |
| Key location 3 | | *Under the Mountain — Amarantha's dark court, site of climactic confrontation* |
| Key location 4 | | *The mortal village — Feyre's impoverished home, what she left behind* |
| Key location 5 | | *The Night Court — a place of stars and darkness, initially frightening, later sanctuary* |
| The contested resource or territory | | *The seven High Lord territories, each controlling different types of magic and land* |
| The barrier separating peoples or characters | | *The Wall prevents humans from entering faerie (without consequence) and keeps fae from crossing south* |
| The dangerous region | | *Under the Mountain — a place of trials, corruption, and enslavement* |
| The isolated location | | *The Spring Court manor — Feyre is the only human, can't leave, surrounded by fae* |
| The significant journey (from → to) | | *Mortal lands → Spring Court (captivity) → Under the Mountain (trial) → Night Court (transformation)* |
| The place that matters emotionally | | *The manor's art gallery — where Feyre finds purpose and connection through painting* |

## Final Thought: Geography Is Story Made Physical

Your map isn't just where things are — it's why characters must make the choices they make. The mountain range is why two nations distrust each other. The desert is why whoever controls the oasis controls the trade route.

Build geography that explains your world and creates the situations your story needs.
