# SECTION 18: The Agency Check

The most powerful romantasy stories are those where characters choose each other despite everything — not because magic forces them, not because prophecy demands it, not because they have no other option. The worldbuilding creates pressure, obstacles, and opportunities, but at the end of the day, the characters must have agency.

Agency means the ability to make meaningful choices. In romance, this is crucial: readers need to believe that these two people genuinely want each other, not that they're biologically compelled, magically bound without consent, or politically trapped with no alternatives.

But here's the challenge: romantasy often includes elements that seem to override choice. Fated mates. Prophecies. Magical bonds. Arranged marriages. These are popular tropes because they create instant stakes and force proximity — but they can accidentally strip characters of agency if you're not careful.

This section helps you test whether your worldbuilding supports character agency or undermines it.

---

## A Note Before You Begin

**Agency doesn't mean easy choices** — characters can face impossible situations and still have agency, as long as they're genuinely choosing rather than being compelled. **Tropes aren't inherently agency-violating** — fated mates, magical bonds, and arranged marriages can all support agency if handled carefully. **The question isn't "are they free?" but "do they choose?"** Characters can be constrained by circumstances and still actively choose each other within those constraints.

---

## Understanding the Agency Paradox

In romantasy, you often want two contradictory things:

**You want:** The relationship to feel destined, inevitable, cosmically significant

**You also want:** The characters to freely choose each other

The best romantasy makes the answer: **"Both."**

The magic/fate/world pushes them together, but they still have to choose to stay. The bond is real, but they have to decide whether to accept it. The prophecy says they're meant to be, but they could still walk away — and what makes the story powerful is that they don't.

**The key question:** If you removed all external pressure, would they still choose each other?

If the answer is no, you have an agency problem.

---

## The Removal Tests

These tests help you determine whether your romance depends on worldbuilding pressure or whether the connection is genuine.

### Test 1: Remove the Magic

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System)

**What magical element connects your characters?**

(Fated mate bond, telepathic link, shared magic, magical contract, curse, soul bond)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without this magic, do they still have reasons to interact?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without the magic, would they still be attracted to each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If you removed the magic entirely, would you still have a story?**

If yes: Good. Magic enhances but doesn't replace organic connection.
If no: You're relying too heavily on magic to do the work of building connection.

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 2: Remove the Prophecy/Destiny

(Reference: Section 6 — Religion, Myth & Prophecy)

**What prophecy or destiny element affects your romance?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without the prophecy, do they still have reason to be together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does prophecy create their connection, or confirm what would happen anyway?**

Best answer: It confirms. They fall in love organically; prophecy is validation, not cause.

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 3: Remove the Political Pressure

(Reference: Section 5 — Government, Power & Law; Section 14 — Institutions)

**What political/institutional element forces them together?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without this force, would they choose to spend time together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do they develop reasons to want to be together beyond obligation?**

Good answer: They start together because they have to, stay because they want to.

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 4: Remove the Dangerous Situation

(Reference: Section 1 — Geography; Section 13 — Pressure Cooker)

**What external danger pushes them together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**In peacetime, with no danger, would they still connect?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is their bond only about survival, or does it include genuine emotional intimacy?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Goal Test

Characters with agency have desires that exist independently of the romance.

**What does your protagonist want before the romance starts?**

(Concrete goal: escape, master magic, find family, survive, defeat enemy, gain freedom, prove themselves)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this goal still matter after they meet the love interest?**

If abandoned entirely: Character may have lost agency. Romance consumed their identity.
If it still matters: Good. They're a full person with their own life.

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the romance complicate their goal?**

Best: Romance and goal conflict, forcing hard choices.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your protagonist have to choose between their original goal and the relationship?**

If yes: Good — meaningful choice demonstrates agency.

_______________________________________________________________

**What does your love interest want that has nothing to do with the protagonist?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does falling for the protagonist complicate those goals?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The "Walking Away" Question

**Could your protagonist walk away from the relationship and still have a complete life?**

Other goals, relationships, purposes that would sustain them?

_______________________________________________________________

**Could your love interest walk away and still have a complete life?**

_______________________________________________________________

If both answers are "yes," then when they choose to stay, it means something. They're choosing each other over viable alternatives.

---

## The Choice Moment

There should be a specific moment where characters actively choose the relationship — not passively accept what fate decided.

**When does your protagonist actively choose the love interest?**

(Specific scene or decision point)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this choice cost them?**

(Safety, power, family approval, original goal, magic, freedom, identity, belonging)

_______________________________________________________________

**When does your love interest actively choose the protagonist?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this choice cost them?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The "Defying the World" Moment

**What worldbuilding element most strongly opposes your romance?**

(Reference Section 16 — which system creates the biggest obstacle)

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment where your character defies this force to be with their love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they risk in this defiance?**

_______________________________________________________________

This defiance is proof of agency — making their own choice against the world's rules.

---

## Making Agency Visible to Readers

It's not enough for agency to exist in your mind — readers need to see it on the page.

**Does the narrative show characters considering alternatives?**

If they never think about other options, readers may not believe they had any.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do characters articulate their choice?**

A moment where they say (aloud or internally) that they're choosing this:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment where they could leave but visibly don't?**

Showing the open door they don't walk through:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do other characters acknowledge that they had a choice?**

Someone saying "you could have walked away" or "you didn't have to do this" confirms agency existed:

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the cost of their choice visible on the page?**

If choosing each other costs something, show what they lose or give up:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Consent Question

### Magical Bonds and Consent

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System, especially bonds)

**Did both characters consent to this bond?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If the bond formed without consent, can they reject it?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they tried to reject it?**

Nothing? Discomfort? Death? Loss of magic? Pain?

_______________________________________________________________

### The Consent Spectrum

**Highest agency:** Bond can be rejected with no consequences. They choose to accept it.

**High agency:** Bond can be rejected at moderate cost. They weigh options and choose.

**Moderate agency:** Bond can be rejected at significant cost. Choice is hard but real.

**Low agency:** Bond cannot be rejected without death or destruction. No choice about the bond, but choice remains in how they live within it.

**No agency:** Bond controls feelings and actions. They cannot choose differently. (This is non-consensual and problematic unless the story is explicitly about breaking free.)

**Where does your bond fall?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If low agency, how do you preserve choice within it?**

(They choose how to treat each other, whether to fight the pull, whether to act on it, what kind of relationship to build within the constraint)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Power Dynamic Check

(Reference: Section 5 — Power structures; Section 4 — Economic power)

### Mapping the Imbalance

**What power does the love interest have that the protagonist doesn't?**

(Political, physical, magical, wealth, knowledge, immortality, status, freedom)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What power does the protagonist have that the love interest doesn't?**

(Information, skills, moral leverage, emotional insight, ability to walk away, connections, knowledge)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the power dynamic shift during the story?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The "Can They Say No?" Test

**Can your protagonist say no to the love interest and have it respected?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Give a specific example of the protagonist saying "no" and it being respected:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If the love interest has pressured or forced the protagonist, how does the story address this?**

Is it acknowledged as wrong? Are there consequences? Must they earn back trust? Or is it romanticized as "passionate"?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Captivity Scenario

**Is either character literally unable to leave?**

(Prisoner, hostage, magically trapped, indentured)

_______________________________________________________________

**If yes, how do you maintain agency within captivity?**

(Choices about cooperation/resistance, mental autonomy, romance doesn't begin until freedom exists or is possible, power dynamic is acknowledged and actively dismantled)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When does the captive gain ability to leave — and what do they choose?**

If they never gain this ability, the romance is fundamentally non-consensual.

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The "Why These Two?" Test

Beyond any magical or political pressure:

**Why would your protagonist be attracted to this specific person?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest have that no one else has — that matters to the protagonist specifically?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the protagonist have that matters uniquely to the love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they see in each other that no one else sees?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Beyond attraction, why do they work together as partners?**

(Balance each other, challenge each other, share values, understand each other's pain, complement each other's strengths)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Alternative Path Test

**What other romantic option exists for your protagonist?**

(Another character, choosing to be alone, a safer/easier relationship)

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do they reject this alternative?**

(Must be a character-driven reason, not just "the bond says so")

_______________________________________________________________

**What other option exists for your love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do they reject it?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there an easier, safer option than being together?**

If yes: Good — choosing the harder path demonstrates agency and commitment.

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Agency in the Ending

The ending must be chosen, not just arrived at.

**Do your characters shape their own ending, or does the plot deliver it to them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a final choice they make that determines the outcome?**

Not just "the villain is defeated and now they're together" but an active decision they make:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could the ending have gone differently if they'd chosen differently?**

If the ending was inevitable regardless of their choices, they didn't have meaningful agency.

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they choose in the final act that proves they're choosing each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the happy ending earned through their choices, or granted by external forces?**

Earned: They made sacrifices, took risks, chose each other actively despite cost.
Granted: The curse just lifted, the prophecy completed itself, the villain conveniently died.

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Agency in Cultural Context

What agency looks like depends on the world you've built.

(Reference: Section 3 — Culture; Section 5 — Government)

**In your world, how much choice do people typically have about their lives and relationships?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is having any choice at all radical in your setting?**

In highly controlled societies, small acts of choice carry enormous weight.

_______________________________________________________________

**What does choosing each other mean within your world's context?**

In some worlds, refusing an arranged marriage is revolutionary. In others, it's ordinary.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are your characters' acts of agency appropriately weighted for your world?**

Small choices in oppressive worlds can be as powerful as dramatic choices in free ones.

_______________________________________________________________

**Do readers from our world need context to understand why their choices matter?**

If choice is rare in your world, make sure readers understand what choosing costs.

_______________________________________________________________

## The Agency Repair Kit

### If the magical bond is doing too much:

- **Add friction:** Even with a bond, they don't automatically like each other. They have to choose to work with it.
- **Add cost to acceptance:** Accepting the bond means giving something up. The choice has weight.
- **Show choosing within the bond:** They control whether to act on it, how they treat each other, what kind of relationship they build.

### If prophecy is removing agency:

- **Make it vague:** Prophecy says they're connected but not how or what it means.
- **Make it resistible:** They can fight it. Maybe it's even wrong. Prophecy is suggestion, not command.
- **Make it a late reveal:** They fall in love first, then discover prophecy validates what already happened.

### If political pressure is removing agency:

- **Give them the option to escape — and show them choosing to stay** for their own reasons.
- **Show them making the arrangement meaningful:** It started political; they chose to make it real.
- **Add genuine choice within the forced situation:** How they treat each other is still their choice.

### If power imbalance is removing agency:

- **Give the less powerful character leverage** — something the powerful one needs.
- **Show the powerful character restraining their power** — choosing not to use it.
- **Address the imbalance explicitly:** Characters acknowledge it and actively work to create equality.

## The Agency Checklist

For strong character agency, you should be able to check most of these:

☐ If I removed all magical bonds/prophecy, they'd still be attracted to each other

☐ Both characters have goals and identity outside the romance

☐ There's a specific moment where each actively chooses the other

☐ This choice costs them something significant

☐ Both characters can (and do) say "no" to each other and have it respected

☐ The less powerful character has meaningful agency within the power dynamic

☐ They have reasons to choose each other beyond "fate says so"

☐ Both resist the relationship at some point before choosing it

☐ Alternatives exist that they consciously reject

☐ Readers can see the choice on the page (not just author intention)

☐ The ending is shaped by their choices, not delivered by plot convenience

**Score:**

8-11 checked: Strong agency — characters are genuinely choosing each other
5-7 checked: Moderate — some elements need strengthening
0-4 checked: Agency problems — worldbuilding may be overriding genuine choice

## Final Thought: Choice Is What Makes It Love

Magic can bring them together. Prophecy can suggest they're meant to be. Political pressure can force proximity. Danger can create intimacy. But at the end of the story, they need to choose each other freely — despite the cost, the alternatives, the easier paths — because of who they are and what they've discovered in each other.

That choice is what separates "they ended up together" from "they chose each other." That choice is what makes it love.
