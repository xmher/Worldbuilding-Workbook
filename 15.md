# SECTION 15: Designing Your Key Locations

You don't need to map every corner of your world. What you need are 3-5 carefully designed locations where pivotal romantic moments happen — places that do narrative work.

A great romantasy location isn't just a pretty backdrop. It's a space with specific constraints that either force connection or make intimacy dangerous. The best locations have physical details that create story pressure: a narrow bridge where they must press close to pass, a garden where anyone might overhear, a cave where darkness strips away defenses.

This section is a workshop. You've built geography (Section 1), established how the natural world works (Section 2), and identified institutions that trap your characters (Section 14). Now you're going to design the specific locations where your romance unfolds — the rooms, gardens, battlefields, and hidden corners where the important moments happen.

## Why Location Design Matters

**Location isn't just "where something happens" — it's part of why it happens.**

A confession in a crowded ballroom means something different than a confession in a private garden. A kiss on a battlefield carries different weight than a kiss in a bedroom. The space shapes what's possible, what's risky, and what it means.

Consider how location affects:

**Physical possibility** — What can characters do in this space? What's impossible?

**Privacy and risk** — Who might see? What are the consequences of discovery?

**Emotional resonance** — What does this place mean to them? What memories does it hold?

**Symbolic weight** — Does the location mirror or contrast with the emotional moment?

---

## Identifying Your Pivotal Moments

Before designing locations, identify the moments that need them.

**List 3-5 major romantic moments in your story:**

(Examples: first meeting, first real conversation, forced to cooperate, first touch, major argument, confession, first kiss, intimate scene, betrayal, reconciliation, final choice)

**Moment 1:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 2:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 3:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 4:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 5:**

_______________________________________________________________

### Matching Moments to Locations

For each moment, consider: Does this scene *need* a specific location, or could it happen anywhere?

If it could happen anywhere, you have a location problem. The best scenes are shaped by where they happen.

**Moment 1** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 2** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 3** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 4** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 5** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

## What Makes a Location Work

Before designing specific locations, understand what makes locations effective in romantasy.

### Locations That Force Connection

Some spaces push characters together whether they want it or not:

- **Narrow spaces** — Corridors, bridges, paths where they must stand close
- **Shared resources** — One fire, one water source, one shelter
- **Dangerous surroundings** — Safety requires staying together
- **Limited seating/standing room** — Must be near each other
- **Tasks requiring cooperation** — Work that needs two people

### Locations That Enable Intimacy

Some spaces allow moments that wouldn't be possible elsewhere:

- **Privacy** — No witnesses, ability to speak freely
- **Beauty** — Setting that creates romantic atmosphere
- **Comfort** — Warmth, safety, permission to relax
- **Liminal spaces** — Between places, outside normal rules
- **Neutral ground** — Neither's territory, both somewhat vulnerable

### Locations That Create Risk

Some spaces make intimacy dangerous:

- **Public but feels private** — Could be seen at any moment
- **Enemy territory** — Being discovered means death
- **Sacred spaces** — Intimacy here is transgression
- **Watched spaces** — Someone is always observing
- **Time-limited** — They'll be interrupted soon

### Locations That Reveal Character

Some spaces show us who characters really are:

- **Their home territory** — Seeing where they come from
- **Their workplace** — Seeing them in their element
- **Under stress** — How they act in dangerous locations
- **In comfort** — Who they are when they can relax

## Location Template

Use this template for each key location. The questions are designed to help you think through how the location affects your scene.

---

## LOCATION: _____________________________________________

### The Physical Space

**Describe the location in 2-3 sentences. What's the dominant impression?**

(Think: size, lighting, temperature, sounds, smells, textures)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What sensory details would your characters notice most?**

What they see: __________________________________________________

What they hear: _________________________________________________

What they smell: ________________________________________________

What they feel (temperature, texture, air): ___________________________

### Physical Constraints

**What does this space force or prevent?**

| Force (what must happen) | Prevent (what can't happen) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**What features define the space?**

Size/layout: ____________________________________________________

Exits/entrances: _________________________________________________

Barriers/obstacles: _______________________________________________

Dangerous elements: _____________________________________________

**What makes this location difficult to reach or leave?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Privacy & Risk

**How private is this location?**

☐ Completely private — no chance of interruption

☐ Semi-private — could be interrupted but unlikely

☐ Risky — interruption is possible at any moment

☐ Public — others are present or could arrive

**Who else could be here? Who has access?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were discovered here together?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they see/hear someone approaching, or could they be surprised?**

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Enables

**What can happen here that couldn't happen elsewhere?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What comfort, safety, or resource does this location provide?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimacy does the space allow?**

Physical (can they touch, stand close, be comfortable):

_______________________________________________________________

Emotional (can they speak freely, show vulnerability):

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Prevents or Denies

**What intimacy is impossible here — and why?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they want that this location won't allow?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Time and Atmosphere

**How does this location change at different times?**

Dawn: _________________________________________________________

Midday: _______________________________________________________

Dusk: _________________________________________________________

Night: _________________________________________________________

**What time does the pivotal scene happen, and why that time?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How might weather transform this space?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is weather significant in the scene that happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

### History & Memory

(Reference Section 7 for your world's history)

**What happened in this place before your characters arrive?**

Has this location witnessed significant events? What ghosts linger?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters know the history of this place?**

Does knowledge of the past affect how they feel here?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this location have personal significance to either character?**

A place from their past, a meaningful memory, somewhere they've been before?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Moment

**What pivotal moment happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why must it happen HERE specifically?**

What about this location makes the moment possible, inevitable, or more meaningful?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Locations That Recur

Some locations appear multiple times in a story. Each return should feel different because the characters and relationship have changed.

### Designing a Recurring Location

**If characters return to a location, what changes between visits?**

| Visit | Relationship State | What's Different |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| First visit | | |
| Second visit | | |
| Third visit | | |
| Final visit | | |

**What do they notice on return that they missed before?**

Details that only matter now, things that look different in light of what's happened:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does their behavior in this space change?**

Where they stand, how close, what they're comfortable doing:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the location itself change, or only their perception of it?**

Physical changes (seasons, damage, decay, growth) vs. emotional changes (what it means to them):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### "Their" Place

**Do your characters have a location that becomes specifically theirs?**

A place they return to, where significant moments keep happening:

_______________________________________________________________

**How does it become theirs?**

Through repetition? A significant first moment there? A private ritual they develop?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean to lose access to this place?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Lost Locations

Some significant places are lost — destroyed, changed, or closed forever. The loss of a meaningful location carries weight.

**Is there a location that becomes inaccessible to your characters?**

Destroyed, transformed, forbidden, too dangerous, claimed by enemies, sealed by magic?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What did this location mean to them?**

What happened there? What did it represent? What possibility did it hold?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does losing access to this place affect them?**

Grief? Loss of sanctuary? Loss of possibility? Motivation for action?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there something they wish they'd done there — but now can't?**

A conversation never had, a moment never taken, a chance lost:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the lost location exist only in memory by the end?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Location as Character

The best locations feel alive — not just as settings but as presences that affect the characters. A location can have personality, mood, even a kind of agency.

**Does your location seem to have a will or character of its own?**

A house that feels welcoming or hostile, a forest that seems to lead them somewhere, a room that holds secrets:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the location "respond" to the characters?**

Does it seem to help them (convenient shelter, paths that lead where they need)? Resist them (doors that stick, paths that mislead)? Reveal things to them (hidden rooms, unexpected views)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What personality would you give this location if it were a character?**

Protective, threatening, indifferent, playful, melancholy, ancient, patient?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Cross-Location Connections

### Variety Check

**Do your locations offer different types of pressure and intimacy?**

Look at your key locations. Do you have a mix of:

☐ Public vs. private

☐ Dangerous vs. safe

☐ Forced proximity vs. chosen meeting

☐ Beautiful vs. harsh

☐ Familiar vs. unknown

☐ Their territory vs. neutral ground vs. enemy territory

**If several locations feel similar, how could you change one for more contrast?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Movement Between Locations

**How do characters move between locations?**

Travel together or separately? Is the journey itself significant?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the transition between locations matter?**

The walk from the ballroom to the garden, the journey from the city to the wilderness, the climb from the base of the tower to the top:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Arc of Locations

**How do your locations progress through the story?**

Do they move from public to private? Safe to dangerous? Familiar to unknown? Constraint to freedom?

Beginning locations: ______________________________________________

Middle locations: ________________________________________________

Climax location: _________________________________________________

Resolution location: ______________________________________________

---

## The Final Location

**Where does the romantic climax happen?**

The moment of greatest emotional vulnerability, final confession, or decisive choice:

_______________________________________________________________

**Why is this the right place for this moment?**

Does it echo earlier locations? Represent how far they've come? Offer something they've never had before? Force a final confrontation they've been avoiding?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How is this location different from where they started?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Location Test

A well-designed location does at least two of these:

☐ **Forces physical proximity** (must stand close, touch, share space)

☐ **Creates danger requiring cooperation** (must work together to survive)

☐ **Provides privacy for vulnerability** (can finally speak freely)

☐ **Makes intimacy risky** (discovery would have consequences)

☐ **Offers something one character needs** (forcing them into other's domain)

☐ **Mirrors emotional state** (space reflects their bond)

☐ **Changes meaning as relationship evolves** (same place, different significance)

☐ **Has history that resonates** (past events echo in present moment)

**For each of your key locations, check at least two boxes.**

If a location doesn't do at least two of these things, revise: add a constraint, raise stakes, build in history, adjust symbolism.

## Integration Check

**How do your key locations connect to your geography (Section 1)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do any locations have significant flora/fauna (Section 2)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What cultural significance do locations carry (Section 3)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What historical weight do locations hold (Section 7)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How does technology affect these spaces (Section 9)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do any locations exist within institutions (Section 14)?**

## Final Thought: Locations Work for the Story

Every key location should be doing narrative work. It's not just where something happens — it's part of *why* it happens.

The space should constrain, enable, reveal, or transform. It should make moments possible that couldn't happen elsewhere, or make possible moments dangerous in ways they wouldn't be elsewhere.

If you can move a scene to any other location and nothing changes, the location isn't working hard enough. But if the scene could *only* happen here — because of the privacy, the danger, the history, the physical constraints — then you've designed a location that matters.

Design places that readers will remember because the space itself was part of the story. The best romantic moments don't just happen *in* locations — they happen *because of* them.
