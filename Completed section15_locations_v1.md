# SECTION 15: Designing Your Key Locations

You don't need to map every corner of your world. What you need are 3-5 carefully designed locations where pivotal romantic moments happen — places that do narrative work.

A great romantasy location isn't just a pretty backdrop. It's a space with specific constraints that either force connection or make intimacy dangerous. The best locations have physical details that create story pressure: a narrow bridge where they must press close to pass, a garden where anyone might overhear, a cave where darkness strips away defenses.

This section is a workshop. You've built geography (Section 1), established how the natural world works (Section 2), and identified institutions that trap your characters (Section 14). Now you're going to design the specific locations where your romance unfolds — the rooms, gardens, battlefields, and hidden corners where the important moments happen.

---

## A Note Before You Begin

**Focus on pivotal moments** — routine scenes can happen in generic spaces. Save detailed location design for first meetings, confessions, arguments, reconciliations, and climaxes. **You can design as you write** — use this section for planning or revision. **One great location beats five mediocre ones** — a single well-designed recurring location can carry more weight than multiple barely-sketched spaces.

---

## How to Think About Locations in Romantasy

Locations in romantasy function as **active forces** rather than passive backdrops. The space doesn't just contain the scene — it shapes what can happen, what's risky, and what it means. A confession in a crowded ballroom means something different than a confession in a private garden, not just because of the audience but because of what each space allows and prevents.

The key insight is that great locations do narrative work. They force, prevent, reveal, or transform. The physical reality of the space creates possibilities and constraints that drive the scene.

### The Location-as-Pressure Framework

When designing locations for romantic moments, consider what kind of pressure the space creates:

**Proximity pressure:** Does the space push characters together?
- Narrow spaces requiring closeness
- Shared resources (one fire, one shelter)
- Limited seating or standing room
- Danger that makes separation unsafe

**Privacy pressure:** Does the space make intimacy possible or risky?
- Complete privacy enabling vulnerability
- Semi-privacy creating tension (could be discovered)
- Public space requiring performance
- Surveillance making every moment watched

**Time pressure:** Does the space create urgency?
- Limited time before interruption
- A moment that won't come again
- Danger approaching
- The space itself temporary or closing

**Symbolic pressure:** Does the space mirror or contrast the emotion?
- Beautiful spaces for romantic moments
- Harsh spaces for difficult truths
- Familiar spaces for comfort
- Alien spaces for transformation

### The "Only Here" Principle

The most effective location design creates scenes that could *only* happen in that specific place. If you can move the scene to any other location without changing anything, the location isn't doing work.

Ask: What about this space makes this moment possible, necessary, or more meaningful? If you can't answer, either redesign the location or reimagine the scene to use the location's specific features.

## Common Patterns: Locations in Romantasy

### Location Types and Their Functions

| Location Type | What It Creates | Best Used For |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **The private chamber** | True privacy; no witnesses; permission to be real | Confessions, intimacy, arguments, vulnerability |
| **The public space** | Audience; performance; stolen glances | Tension, restraint, the gap between public and private |
| **The dangerous place** | Survival stakes; adrenaline; forced cooperation | Bonding through shared danger; revealing true character |
| **The beautiful space** | Romantic atmosphere; wonder; emotional openness | Key romantic moments; emotional turning points |
| **The liminal space** | Between places; outside normal rules; suspension | Moments of possibility; decisions; transitions |
| **The familiar place** | Comfort; history; meaning | Reconciliation; return; seeing with new eyes |
| **The alien place** | Disorientation; new rules; vulnerability | Transformation; revelation; stepping into other's world |

### How Locations Enable Romantic Moments

| What You Need | Location Features That Provide It |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Physical proximity | Narrow spaces, shared shelter, limited room |
| Privacy for vulnerability | Enclosed spaces, remote locations, times of isolation |
| Danger that bonds | Hostile environment, enemies nearby, survival stakes |
| Risk that creates tension | Semi-public spaces, surveillance, possible discovery |
| Time pressure | Approaching danger, limited access, temporary spaces |
| Revelation of character | Their home territory, their workplace, under stress |
| Symbolic resonance | Beautiful for romance, harsh for truth, sacred for vows |

## Common Mistakes with Location Design

### Mistake #1: The Interchangeable Backdrop

Scenes happen in locations, but the locations don't affect anything — dialogue could happen anywhere, setting described but not shaping action. When location doesn't matter, you're wasting one of your most powerful tools. For each pivotal scene, ask: What can *only* happen here? What does this location force, prevent, or enable? If you can't answer, revise to add specific features that affect the scene — a narrow space forcing closeness, a danger requiring cooperation, beauty that opens vulnerability.

### Mistake #2: The Convenient Privacy

Characters need private conversation and conveniently, a private space appears; everyone else vanishes whenever the plot needs it. If privacy is easy, it's not precious. The difficulty of finding private moments is part of what makes them valuable. Make privacy genuinely scarce: establish who's around, who might interrupt, what spaces exist. Make characters *work* for private moments — finding gaps in surveillance, creating distractions, risking discovery. The effort makes the moments matter.

### Mistake #3: The Featureless Space

Locations are named but not described — we know we're in "a garden" but not what makes this garden specific. Physical details are absent or generic. Specific details create immersion and possibility: a garden with a hidden alcove is different from one with exposed paths; a bedroom with a locked door is different from one with thin walls. Give each key location specific features that matter — the narrow bridge, the low wall someone could hide behind, the fire that's the only source of warmth. These details become story tools.

### Mistake #4: The Single-Purpose Space

Each location appears once, serves one scene, and is never used again. Recurring locations accumulate meaning — when characters return to the same space, we see how they've changed. One-use locations can't develop this resonance. Consider using fewer locations more often. Identify spaces that could become "theirs" — places they return to, where meaning accumulates. The garden where they first spoke and later fight and finally reconcile carries weight that three different gardens couldn't.

## Why Location Design Matters

**Location isn't just "where something happens" — it's part of why it happens.**

A confession in a crowded ballroom means something different than a confession in a private garden. A kiss on a battlefield carries different weight than a kiss in a bedroom. The space shapes what's possible, what's risky, and what it means.

Consider how location affects:

**Physical possibility** — What can characters do in this space? What's impossible?

**Privacy and risk** — Who might see? What are the consequences of discovery?

**Emotional resonance** — What does this place mean to them? What memories does it hold?

**Symbolic weight** — Does the location mirror or contrast with the emotional moment?

---

## Identifying Your Pivotal Moments

Before designing locations, identify the moments that need them.

**List 3-5 major romantic moments in your story:**

(Examples: first meeting, first real conversation, forced to cooperate, first touch, major argument, confession, first kiss, intimate scene, betrayal, reconciliation, final choice)

**Moment 1:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 2:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 3:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 4:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Moment 5:**

_______________________________________________________________

### Matching Moments to Locations

For each moment, consider: Does this scene *need* a specific location, or could it happen anywhere?

If it could happen anywhere, you have a location problem. The best scenes are shaped by where they happen.

**Moment 1** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 2** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 3** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 4** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

**Moment 5** happens in: ____________________________________________

Why it must happen there: _________________________________________

## What Makes a Location Work

Before designing specific locations, understand what makes locations effective in romantasy.

### Locations That Force Connection

Some spaces push characters together whether they want it or not:

- **Narrow spaces** — Corridors, bridges, paths where they must stand close
- **Shared resources** — One fire, one water source, one shelter
- **Dangerous surroundings** — Safety requires staying together
- **Limited seating/standing room** — Must be near each other
- **Tasks requiring cooperation** — Work that needs two people

### Locations That Enable Intimacy

Some spaces allow moments that wouldn't be possible elsewhere:

- **Privacy** — No witnesses, ability to speak freely
- **Beauty** — Setting that creates romantic atmosphere
- **Comfort** — Warmth, safety, permission to relax
- **Liminal spaces** — Between places, outside normal rules
- **Neutral ground** — Neither's territory, both somewhat vulnerable

### Locations That Create Risk

Some spaces make intimacy dangerous:

- **Public but feels private** — Could be seen at any moment
- **Enemy territory** — Being discovered means death
- **Sacred spaces** — Intimacy here is transgression
- **Watched spaces** — Someone is always observing
- **Time-limited** — They'll be interrupted soon

### Locations That Reveal Character

Some spaces show us who characters really are:

- **Their home territory** — Seeing where they come from
- **Their workplace** — Seeing them in their element
- **Under stress** — How they act in dangerous locations
- **In comfort** — Who they are when they can relax

## Location Template

Use this template for each key location. The questions are designed to help you think through how the location affects your scene.

---

## LOCATION: _____________________________________________

### The Physical Space

**Describe the location in 2-3 sentences. What's the dominant impression?**

(Think: size, lighting, temperature, sounds, smells, textures)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What sensory details would your characters notice most?**

What they see: __________________________________________________

What they hear: _________________________________________________

What they smell: ________________________________________________

What they feel (temperature, texture, air): ___________________________

### Physical Constraints

**What does this space force or prevent?**

| Force (what must happen) | Prevent (what can't happen) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**What features define the space?**

Size/layout: ____________________________________________________

Exits/entrances: _________________________________________________

Barriers/obstacles: _______________________________________________

Dangerous elements: _____________________________________________

**What makes this location difficult to reach or leave?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Privacy & Risk

**How private is this location?**

☐ Completely private — no chance of interruption

☐ Semi-private — could be interrupted but unlikely

☐ Risky — interruption is possible at any moment

☐ Public — others are present or could arrive

**Who else could be here? Who has access?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were discovered here together?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they see/hear someone approaching, or could they be surprised?**

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Enables

**What can happen here that couldn't happen elsewhere?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What comfort, safety, or resource does this location provide?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimacy does the space allow?**

Physical (can they touch, stand close, be comfortable):

_______________________________________________________________

Emotional (can they speak freely, show vulnerability):

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Prevents or Denies

**What intimacy is impossible here — and why?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they want that this location won't allow?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Time and Atmosphere

**How does this location change at different times?**

Dawn: _________________________________________________________

Midday: _______________________________________________________

Dusk: _________________________________________________________

Night: _________________________________________________________

**What time does the pivotal scene happen, and why that time?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How might weather transform this space?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is weather significant in the scene that happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

### History & Memory

(Reference Section 7 for your world's history)

**What happened in this place before your characters arrive?**

Has this location witnessed significant events? What ghosts linger?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters know the history of this place?**

Does knowledge of the past affect how they feel here?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this location have personal significance to either character?**

A place from their past, a meaningful memory, somewhere they've been before?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Moment

**What pivotal moment happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why must it happen HERE specifically?**

What about this location makes the moment possible, inevitable, or more meaningful?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Locations That Recur

Some locations appear multiple times in a story. Each return should feel different because the characters and relationship have changed.

Recurring locations are one of the most powerful tools in romantic storytelling. The same space means something different each time. Where they stood, how close they were, what they were comfortable doing — all change as the relationship evolves. The reader notices these changes even unconsciously.

Consider making at least one location a recurring space. A garden they return to, a room they keep finding each other in, a spot that becomes "theirs." Each visit layers meaning onto the next.

### Designing a Recurring Location

**If characters return to a location, what changes between visits?**

| Visit | Relationship State | What's Different |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| First visit | | |
| Second visit | | |
| Third visit | | |
| Final visit | | |

**What do they notice on return that they missed before?**

Details that only matter now, things that look different in light of what's happened:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does their behavior in this space change?**

Where they stand, how close, what they're comfortable doing:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the location itself change, or only their perception of it?**

Physical changes (seasons, damage, decay, growth) vs. emotional changes (what it means to them):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### "Their" Place

**Do your characters have a location that becomes specifically theirs?**

A place they return to, where significant moments keep happening:

_______________________________________________________________

**How does it become theirs?**

Through repetition? A significant first moment there? A private ritual they develop?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean to lose access to this place?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Lost Locations

Some significant places are lost — destroyed, changed, or closed forever. The loss of a meaningful location carries weight.

Lost locations create permanent stakes. When a place that mattered is gone, the moments that happened there become irreplaceable. Characters can't go back. What they had there, they can never have again — except in memory.

The threat of losing a location can also create urgency. If characters know a place will be destroyed, every moment there becomes precious. The impermanence intensifies the present.

**Is there a location that becomes inaccessible to your characters?**

Destroyed, transformed, forbidden, too dangerous, claimed by enemies, sealed by magic?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What did this location mean to them?**

What happened there? What did it represent? What possibility did it hold?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does losing access to this place affect them?**

Grief? Loss of sanctuary? Loss of possibility? Motivation for action?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there something they wish they'd done there — but now can't?**

A conversation never had, a moment never taken, a chance lost:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the lost location exist only in memory by the end?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Location as Character

The best locations feel alive — not just as settings but as presences that affect the characters. A location can have personality, mood, even a kind of agency.

When a location feels like a character, it becomes more than backdrop. The old house that seems to resist intruders, the garden that always seems to lead them to each other, the battlefield that feels haunted by old deaths — these spaces have presence.

This works especially well in fantasy where magic can make locations literally responsive. A house that's enchanted to protect its inhabitants, a forest that moves its paths, a palace that remembers — these take "location as character" literally.

**Does your location seem to have a will or character of its own?**

A house that feels welcoming or hostile, a forest that seems to lead them somewhere, a room that holds secrets:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the location "respond" to the characters?**

Does it seem to help them (convenient shelter, paths that lead where they need)? Resist them (doors that stick, paths that mislead)? Reveal things to them (hidden rooms, unexpected views)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What personality would you give this location if it were a character?**

Protective, threatening, indifferent, playful, melancholy, ancient, patient?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Cross-Location Connections

### Variety Check

**Do your locations offer different types of pressure and intimacy?**

Look at your key locations. Do you have a mix of:

☐ Public vs. private

☐ Dangerous vs. safe

☐ Forced proximity vs. chosen meeting

☐ Beautiful vs. harsh

☐ Familiar vs. unknown

☐ Their territory vs. neutral ground vs. enemy territory

**If several locations feel similar, how could you change one for more contrast?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Movement Between Locations

**How do characters move between locations?**

Travel together or separately? Is the journey itself significant?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the transition between locations matter?**

The walk from the ballroom to the garden, the journey from the city to the wilderness, the climb from the base of the tower to the top:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Arc of Locations

**How do your locations progress through the story?**

Do they move from public to private? Safe to dangerous? Familiar to unknown? Constraint to freedom?

Beginning locations: ______________________________________________

Middle locations: ________________________________________________

Climax location: _________________________________________________

Resolution location: ______________________________________________

---

## The Final Location

**Where does the romantic climax happen?**

The moment of greatest emotional vulnerability, final confession, or decisive choice:

_______________________________________________________________

**Why is this the right place for this moment?**

Does it echo earlier locations? Represent how far they've come? Offer something they've never had before? Force a final confrontation they've been avoiding?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How is this location different from where they started?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Location Test

A well-designed location does at least two of these:

☐ **Forces physical proximity** (must stand close, touch, share space)

☐ **Creates danger requiring cooperation** (must work together to survive)

☐ **Provides privacy for vulnerability** (can finally speak freely)

☐ **Makes intimacy risky** (discovery would have consequences)

☐ **Offers something one character needs** (forcing them into other's domain)

☐ **Mirrors emotional state** (space reflects their bond)

☐ **Changes meaning as relationship evolves** (same place, different significance)

☐ **Has history that resonates** (past events echo in present moment)

**For each of your key locations, check at least two boxes.**

If a location doesn't do at least two of these things, revise: add a constraint, raise stakes, build in history, adjust symbolism.

## Final Thought: Locations Work for the Story

Every key location should be doing narrative work — not just where something happens, but part of *why* it happens. Build locations with specific physical features that affect the scene, pressure (proximity, privacy, risk, time), meaning that accumulates through repetition, and connection to your larger world.

The space should constrain, enable, reveal, or transform. If you can move a scene to any other location and nothing changes, the location isn't working hard enough. But if the scene could *only* happen here — because of the privacy, danger, history, or physical constraints — then you've designed a location that matters.

The best romantic moments don't just happen *in* locations — they happen *because of* them.
