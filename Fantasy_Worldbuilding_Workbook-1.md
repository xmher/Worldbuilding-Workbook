# Fantasy Worldbuilding Workbook

**School of Plot**

---

## Dear Writer,

Congratulations on deciding to write a story! Whether it's your first story or your 100th, and whether you started years ago or this morning, your words are valuable.

Writing isn't always easy, but by committing to this project, you've already done better than anyone who's just dreaming about it.

Finally, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting this small business (actually, a super small business ...it's just 1 person!)

Wishing you all the best!

## Before You Begin: Worldbuilding

While you go through this workbook, consider this question: **How much of your world do you need to show to enhance and support the story?**

If there's something in the workbook that doesn't add anything to your world, you can fill it in for fun, or skip it completely and delete the pages.

Some authors like to know every single thing about their worlds before they begin. Some don't, and that's fine! Use this workbook in a way that suits you best.

Also try to consider how you can pepper these details in, or naturally incorporate them as much as possible without dumping too much exposition in one go.

Happy worldbuilding, writer!

### Advice from Sir Terry Pratchett

Here's some golden advice from Sir Terry Pratchett, a master of fantasy worldbuilding:

> "Apply logic in places where it wasn't intended to exist. [...] If there is magic, where does it come from? Why isn't everyone using it? What rules will you have to give it to allow some tension in your story? How does society operate? Where does the food come from?
>
> You need to know how your world works. I can't stress that last point enough. Fantasy works best when you take it seriously.
>
> Taking it seriously means that there must be rules.
>
> If anything can happen, then there is no real suspense."

This doesn't mean you need to plan every single detail — it's more important to write — but it does mean some thought should go into your world.

# Cities & Lands

## How Do I Name Places?

A good guide is to find the real language that sounds closest to the one spoken in your world.

Then google **"[language] + toponymy"** — this should teach you how that real-world language names its towns and cities.

### English Toponymy

A lot of places are named after nature (e.g. Blackwood), or take a name inspired by a local person who owned the land (usually nobility).

If your setting is similar to the UK or Ireland, check out the following cheat sheets that take you through some basics, to show you how it works. You can even take a prefix from one table and add it to a suffix from the other.

Having said that, your setting name doesn't need to mean something if it's taking up too much of your energy. It's a nice touch, but not a necessity.

## Place Name Cheat Sheet: Suffixes

| Suffix | Meaning | In a Place Name |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| -ham | homestead / village | Dagenham |

## Map Making

You don't need a map. However, it can help you to visualise your world a little better. You can draw your own map, or use a builder.

**Map-Makers (Links):** Inkarnate, Canva (Maps), Aazgar's, Donjon's, World Anvil (£), Nortantis

### Should I draw my own map or generate one?

You really don't need a map to start your story. If you want to make one, in order to flesh out your world and make it feel a bit more real, try and make it with some intentionality. Consider the needs of your story, and the vibe you're trying to convey. Adding fountains and gardens is going to have a different effect to adding lots of graveyards, gallows, and abattoirs.

### What to Include in the Map

Here are some things you can choose to include in your map, if you choose to make one:

Tavern, Inn, Healer, Apothecary, Armorer, Outfitter, Chapel, Church, Forge, Weapon shop, Potion shop, Bakery, Butcher's, Bank, Stables, Smith, Guardhouse, Well, Gallows, Memorial, Jail, Gatehouse, Market, Fishery, Docks, Mansion, Town gate, Town walls, Moat, Abattoir, Statue, Fountain, Bridge, Abbey, Nunnery, Schools, University, Library, Manor house, Moorland, Barracks, Secret passage, Graveyard, Ley lines, Stronghold, Cave, Town hall, Farmstead, Barns, Windmill, Granary, Banks, Theatre, Arena, Forest, Castle, River, Lighthouse, Citadel, Ruins

---

## Fantasy / Historical Travel Calculator

Don't get too tied up in realism, because nobody's going to check this stuff. But if you want a ballpark estimate of how long it'll take your characters to cross their map...

| 1 day of... | Miles | Km |
|-------------|-------|----|
| Walking | 20 | 32 |
| Riding Horse | 30 | 50 |
| Hard Ride | 40–50 | 65–80 |
| Changing Horses | 100 | 160 |

*Info source: https://indiesunlimited.com/*

This is for a healthy adult who takes realistic breaks! Children, the elderly, or people carrying many things might be slower. It also depends on terrain. If you're writing stories set at sea, it depends on the ship's size as well as the conditions at sea.

## Natural Resources

When lands have natural resources, they can become a huge part of the culture. They might even appear on the flag. This resource can be used for trade with other lands, and can affect the weapons, tools, fashion, architecture, and more.

**Ideas of resources to give your lands:**

Gold / Silver, Ores (iron, etc), Quality stones, Gemstones, Pearls, Amber, Silk, Linen, Ivory, Special fur, Wool, Sugar, Spices, Salt, Animal fat, Special plants, Special beasts, Magic stones, Dyes, Coral, Coal, Wood, Charcoal, Oil, Wine/Grapes, Fossils, Adder stones

### How Resources May Affect Culture

| Resource | Cultural Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| **Timber** | Architecture heavily relies on timber. Forests are considered sacred. Carpentry is a valued skill. |
| **Gold** | Economy revolves around mining and gold trade. Emphasis on ornate craftsmanship. |
| **Wool** | Textile production and weaving are common jobs. A nomadic lifestyle may be prevalent (e.g. sheep herders) and sheep's milk / mutton may feature heavily in the diet OR sheep may be seen as holy. |
| **Grain** | Agriculture is central to the culture. Festivals and traditions celebrate the harvest and seasonal cycles. May worship a harvest god. |
| **Salt** | Unique food due to salt-preservation being common. Salt mining is a common job. |
| **Spices** | Unique food. Spice markets as trading hubs. Some spices may be seen to have healing benefits. |
| **Ores** | Metalworking may aid technological advancement. Advanced weapons and tools. Mining communities. May worship a god of the forge. |
| **Tea** | Tea cultivation, preparation, and rituals are part of the culture's traditions. Tea houses are social hubs. Tea trade impacts regional / international relations. |
| **Clay** | May have advanced pottery-making and ceramic arts. Clay-based construction materials influence architecture. Cuisine uses clay-based tools. |
| **Fish / Sea / Ports** | Fish and seafood-based cuisine. Fishermen, pearl divers, sailmakers, sailors and other sea-related jobs may be common in a coastal nation. May worship sea gods. Nation may have a strong navy, and/or a tradition of sea faring trade and exploration. May be a trade hub due to the ports. Seashells may be used in crafts & jewellery. |
| **Gems** | Mining and jewellery making thrive. Cultural celebration may revolve around elaborate jewelled ornaments or garments. |
| **Coal** | Coal mining is popular. Mining towns pop up around coal-rich areas. Technology may develop quickly due to coal power, leading to advancements in manufacturing, transportation, communication, and more. |

## A Brief Note on Architecture

What do your civilisations look like? A palace can look so different depending on your culture, as can a peasant's house.

*Battlements? Pyramid of steps? Dome tops?*

If you want to echo the feel of an architectural style from a real culture, make a list of distinctive elements seen in their buildings. See which ones you can use when describing your own world.

### Writing Your World's Architecture

The weather of your land (as well as your land's culture) will affect the architecture.

- **Rainy:** May have sloped roofs, covered walkways, gutter systems and overhangs. Life may be more concentrated indoors.
- **Snowy:** Reinforced roofs (to avoid collapse), thicker insulation, snow sheds or snow fences to control snow accumulation, vestibules or mudrooms to trap melting snow.
- **Windy/Coastal:** Streamlined shapes, reinforced structures, impact-resistant windows and doors, windbreaks, and secure anchoring systems.
- **Hot/Sunny:** Shading elements such as eaves, awnings, or louvers, high thermal mass materials for passive cooling, cross-ventilation by strategic window placement, courtyards or atriums, and flat, light-coloured roofs to reduce heat absorption.

# History & Politics

## Do You Need to Write Your World's History?

Your world did not just spring out of nowhere. Worlds seem more real and more complex if their histories are shown.

This helps your world to feel tangible, and less like a two-dimensional movie set.

This doesn't mean you have to spend 7 paragraphs explaining origins of grain tax.

However, history is all around us. Do your characters hang out in an old ruined temple of a long-forgotten religion? Is the palace full of statues of ancient heroes?

The same applies to politics. Even if you don't describe it in detail, it's there, and it might affect your characters. You can choose to go into as much or as little detail as you like.

---

## Types of Government

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Empire** | Empires can be made up of smaller states/countries with their own government, but are controlled by an emperor/empress. |
| **Monarchy** | King/queen rules the state. Ownership passes by bloodline. |
| **Oligarchy** | Power lies with a small group of individuals with wealth, military power, or nobility. |
| **Republic** | The people elect representatives, who vote to make laws. Their leader is elected, unlike in a monarchy. |
| **Democracy** | Laws are made by the people. The majority rules. Everyone gets to vote. |
| **Federation** | Small states manage their own affairs, but are controlled by one central government. |
| **Confederation** | Small states manage their own affairs, but are unified by one central government. The small states can overrule the central government, unlike in a federation. |

---

## How to Design Fictional Currency

*Feel free to delete these pages if you don't want to go into this level of detail — you really don't need to unless it's fun for you!*

**Materials:** A common choice is to make coins from gold, silver, or copper. You can explore materials such as gems, crystals, stones, valuable goods, magic runes, and other materials that the land may value.

**Naming:** The name of your currency should align with the cultural and historical context of your world. Refer to your language sheet. Common choices for naming coins include taking the names of old real-world currency (crowns, florins, etc.) or creating a new name that reflects the material of your currency (e.g. if gemstones are used as currency, you could measure gold/gemstone currency in carats).

**Value:** You could choose to include denominations (e.g. 1 pound is worth 100 pennies) but don't let it confuse the reader. Some currency value is intuitive (gold > silver > bronze, or diamonds > common gems).

### Common Symbols on Currency

Coins often feature a variety of symbols that hold historical, cultural, or national significance such as: Monarch, Coat of Arms, Plantlife, Animal, Religious Symbol, Mythological figure.

This can be a fun way to incorporate some subtle worldbuilding. A character could reach for a coin bearing the face of the monarch, or the kingdom's treasured animal, leading to a bit of quick, natural exposition.

# Magic System

## How to Write Magic

If you want to create magic for this world, you have to create rules that the magic must abide by.

Creative people don't tend to like being restricted, so this idea is often unpopular with new writers.

However, without rules, the story is easily picked apart and undermined: *"Well why can't the good guys just snap their fingers and fix everything?"*

Rules are there to make your story and world make sense to readers, and also to create tension. **Your magic needs limitations for your story to be engaging.**

---

## Soft vs. Hard Magic

**Soft magic** refers to magic systems in storytelling characterised by vague, undefined, or unexplained natures. The focus is on the narrative and emotional impact of magic. Magic often takes a backseat in stories like this, which tend to be more focused on other aspects. Because the magic has very few "rules", it is limited by other factors such as personal reluctance, social taboo, inability, etc.

**Hard magic** refers to a magic system with well-defined rules and limitations. Avatar: The Last Airbender is often given as an example of an understandable hard magic system (e.g. you know that a waterbender can't control fire). For a literary example, Brandon Sanderson is famous for his hard magic systems.

Both hard and soft magic systems are great, but hard magic systems may take more planning.

| Feature | Hard | Soft |
|---------|------|------|
| Rules | Clearly defined | Vague or undefined |
| Outcomes | Consistent | Flexible |
| Characters | Must use magic strategically and cleverly | Often more emphasis on emotion |
| Tool | Magic can be used as a problem-solving tool | Magic is often symbolic or metaphorical |
| Limitations | Magic itself has clearly defined limits | Vague limits, or limits outside magic itself (e.g. personal reluctance, lack of practice, trauma) |
| Exposition | Often explained via teaching or training scenes | Often unexplained or intuitive |

However, these are just guidelines. Don't feel pressure to label your system if you don't want to.

---

## Types of Magic

There are many types of magic systems to choose from, and here are some ideas:

- **Elemental Magic:** Manipulation and control of the classical elements: fire, water, earth, and air.
- **Hereditary Magic:** Certain families have magical abilities that are passed down genetically. It may be that one specific skill (e.g. mind reading) is inherent to one bloodline, or it can be more random.
- **Incantations:** A specific set of words has a specific result (e.g. spoken spells).
- **Ritual Magic:** Rituals and offerings invoke supernatural beings like demons or fae. This may involve the use of a grimoire.
- **Tool-Based Magic:** You need an item (wand, staff, amulet, etc.) to perform magic.
- **Contagious Magic:** If you touch a specific magic item/artefact, you obtain (often soft) magic.
- **Celestial Magic:** Practitioners draw their power from celestial bodies (stars, moons, planets, etc.)
- **Portal Magic:** Portals can be created, or normal objects (e.g. mirrors) can be turned into portals by the magic user.
- **Gifted Magic:** Magic may be gifted by the gods. Your power can be determined by whichever god is your benefactor (e.g. those gifted by the god of love get love powers).
- **Energy Magic:** Magic defined by types of energy (e.g. light, darkness) which practitioners can manipulate and harness to cast spells, etc.
- **Alchemy:** Practitioners may create magical elixirs, transmute elements (such as mercury and iron), or use elemental powders. Different elements may possess different properties.

___

**Where did the magic originally come from?**

___

___

---

## How Do I Write Magical Limitations?

Think of a reason why all magic users aren't unstoppable gods. For example:

- **Skill:** You need to practice very hard to get good. Not everyone is there yet.
- **Physics:** For example, in Avatar: The Last Airbender, metalbenders (who can manipulate metal) can easily break out of a metal cage, so people start trapping them in wooden cages instead.
- **Law:** In BBC's Merlin, magic is punishable by death. This limits our protagonist, who is constantly forced to hide his powers, or risk being executed.
- **Resources:** You can't do magic if you don't have a specific resource. E.g., Harry Potter's wizards are often useless without wands.

## How to Connect Magic with Politics

An interesting thing you may choose to consider incorporating into your worldbuilding is how magic influences political structures in your world.

Those with magical abilities may hold unique positions of influence, or the fear of magic could lead to discrimination and persecution.

The presence of magic may lead to the establishment of magical institutions such as academies or guilds. These institutions could play a role in shaping political ideologies, training leaders, or influencing policy.

The public's perception of magic and magical users can be wielded as a powerful political tool. Leaders might use their own magic to inspire loyalty or fear. Propaganda may shape public opinion regarding the role of magic in society, with magic users being scapegoated.

# Culture

## What Is Culture?

Culture is an umbrella term that describes the norms and behaviours within a culture. It can involve beliefs, arts, laws, customs, food, and habits of the people who live within that culture.

Culture is often shared by people within the same geographical region, or sometimes religion. Although the people will have different individual tastes, a region tends to have its own traditional foods, music, beliefs, and customs.

This is a good way to distinguish two different locations in your story. Consider how geography, climate, and available resources affect the following questions. Repeat the questions for each different culture in your world.

## Should I Invent a Language?

It's not necessary. You can do it if you find it fun, and think it might enrich your world.

Even if you don't invent a language, you can consider how each language spoken in your world might sound.

In the real world, you can tell that Grimsby, Kyoto, and Abu Dhabi are in different countries that speak different languages.

The names of people, places, foods, historical events, and new technologies are likely going to be named based on the language that your characters speak in-universe.

A quick hack for this is to pick a real language and base your naming traditions on that language.

You can collect the following data to help inspire your fictional language's sounds...

---

## Your World's Language

**Your world's language is inspired by...**

___

**Place names in this language:**

___

**Baby names in this language:**

___

**Common sounds in this language:**

___

**Curses:**

___

---

## Basic Words in Your Language

If you choose to dig a little deeper, you could invent some words that may crop up more commonly such as:

| Word | Translation |
|------|-------------|
| Hello | |
| Goodbye | |
| Stop | |
| Yes | |
| No | |
| I love you | |
| Cheers | |
| Be quiet | |
| Sorry | |
| Wait | |
| Friend | |
| Please | |

## Timekeeping

How do they measure days, hours, months, and years in your world? They might use terms like 'years' or 'months' but they will likely not use words like Monday or July.

**Ideas of how your world could measure or record time:** Eclipses, Moon cycle, Seasons, Tide seasons, Harvests, Holidays

If your world has no clocks, you could measure time via sundials, clepsydra, or hourglasses. People may use phrases like "midday", "noon", "dawn", "dusk", "three bells", etc.

For those using sundials, specific markings would indicate the passing of hours. People may say things like "it's three marks past midday" or "it's approaching the eighth hour."

Alternatively you could consider using a generator such as: donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/calendar/ or fantasy-calendar.com

## Creating Your World's Fashion

An easy starting point for creating your world's fashion is to choose a real culture and time period and find a fashion archive of it.

**Helpful links:** Fashion Timeline, Rosalie Gilbert, History of Fashion, Europeana

But consider what sorts of fabrics and dyes different people might have access to. Also consider the functionality of clothes, the climate, and what that means for fabrics and styles. Consider the day-to-day lives of people in this culture, and how that impacts their clothes.

# Religion

## How to Write Religions

Cultures influence religions just as religions influence culture. The two are connected.

If the culture is collectivist, how would this be shown in the religion? If the culture is warlike, what sort of gods would they worship?

You don't have to describe every aspect of your culture's religion to your reader. But it can be nice to get clear on the specifics yourself.

Religion can have a huge, lasting impact on culture, including things like language, cuisine, and marriage. Even "goodbye" comes from a 1500s contraction of the phrase "God be with ye"!

---

## How to Create Fictional Gods

First, decide how many gods you want your religion to have. It can be, for example:

- **Monotheistic:** one god
- **Polytheistic:** many gods

Even within polytheistic religions, there can be a hierarchy. Perhaps the lesser gods answer to a king or queen god. Perhaps they are even merely facets of their ruler.

If your religion is polytheistic, make sure you get the basics down. A lot of real religions have gods who rule over things like the sun, moon, sea, life, death, crops/harvest, fertility, etc. What do civilisations find important? There'll likely be a god for that.

The gods your culture worships says a lot about the culture itself. You can also consider whether (in nations with polytheistic faiths) different regions can favour different gods. For example, in a port town, perhaps they mainly worship their religion's sea god.

Also consider that not all faiths worship gods. There are some religions who have a set of beliefs but not a god. For example, they might believe in an afterlife or reincarnation, but just not gods.

Pantheism is another one to consider. This is the belief that the world is a god. They see divinity in nature.

## Writing Your World's Religions

**Describe your civilisation's culture and its values. Is it warlike? Does it value peace? Is it highly individualistic?**

___

**Describe the geography of your civilisation. What large natural entities are present? Sea? Woodlands? Mountains?**

___

**How might these two aspects be represented in this culture's religion?** Remember how a civilisation's values might be reflected in religion. Also think about whether the location's nature/geography might play a part.

## How to Create Folk Tales

Every culture in society has fables and myths. They often served as a way to explain natural phenomena (e.g. why the sun sets) or to warn people about dangers (e.g. "a fire god lives in that mountain so don't go in there" — about a volcano).

You don't need to halt your story to dump some exposition about a children's fable, but consider how folk stories might influence language, culture, and attitudes towards certain things.

For example, in English we say things like "he was an Adonis", "it was a Cinderella story" and "that's a Herculean task".

---

## Folklore Questions

___

**How would you show this through a fable?**

# Plants & Animals

## How to Write Nature

Just because you're writing a new world, it doesn't mean you need to invent your own plants and animals, but you can.

Even if you use animals that already exist on Earth, perhaps your world has a different relationship with them. Perhaps they evolved differently due to the setting.

As for plants, consider how they might be used in food, medicine, and magic. Every bit of worldbuilding you do can make your world feel richer and more real.

However, don't get bogged down in it unless this is something you're excited to write. As always, feel free to delete pages if needed.

## Inventing New Animals

Think about the climate, geography, and magical influences of the region where these animals live. This will impact their physical traits, behaviours, and adaptations. For example, an animal in a colder region could have a larger size and more blubber and fur.

Do they have magical abilities, or are they influenced by the magic in their environment? Perhaps your animals have evolved alongside magic, developing defences against it.

When designing your world's animals, you could consider combining two or more types of existing animals, or getting some inspiration from mythology.

If you decide to create animals for your fantasy world, you can duplicate the next page to keep track of your species.

## Herbs & Potions

One significant role plants may play in your fantasy world could be in the creation of potions, remedies, and medical treatments. Perhaps your plants have magical powers such as healing abilities or enhancement of magical powers, for example.

You could even incorporate some believed medical/magical properties of real world plants when crafting potions or herbal remedies.

You don't have to go into this level of detail, but it can be useful if you have characters who are herbalists, gardeners, healers, potion-makers, traders specialising in rare herbs, or nature-based witches.

You can also use this section to develop fictional poisons.

## Naming Plants

Certain plants and herbs have allegedly been historically referred to by interesting and sometimes peculiar nicknames, which you could draw inspiration from, such as:

| Plant | Nickname |
|-------|----------|
| Mustard seed | Eye of newt |
| Dandelion | Tooth of lion |

While there's debate about how historically true this is, it can be fun to name your fantasy plants using this convention:

| Body Part (code) | Plant Part |
|-------------------|------------|
| Eye | Blossom or Seed |
| Heart | Bud or Seed |
| Beak, Bill, Nose | Seed, Bud, or Bloom |
| Tongue or Teeth | Petal or Leaf |
| Head | Blossom |
| Tail | Stem |
| Hair | Dried or stringy part |
| Blood | Sap |
| Guts | Roots or Stalk |
| Paw, Foot, Leg, Wing, or Toe | Leaves |

*E.g. a plant with scaly leaves may be named Dragon's Foot.*

# Other Species

## How Do I Write a New Species?

If your world has more than one intelligent species, then you should put some thought into how this affects culture and society.

Sure, there can be mermaids. But how would your parents react if you brought one home? Is it a normal thing that they could expect, or is it more akin to a human from Earth bringing home a trout and introducing it as his wife?

Generally, if your world has multiple intelligent species, they will each stick to their own territory, or have conflict with each other.

Ask questions, and consider doing research to avoid coding any fantasy species with traits associated with real groups.

---

## Traits for Fantasy Species

When designing a species, here are some traits you can pick from:

Scales, Feathers, Fangs, Claws, Antlers, Beak, Wings, Fins, Long ears, Bioluminescent, Gills, Serrated teeth, Amphibious, Sharp quills, Pouch or sac, Multiple tails, Blindsight, Tentacles, Telepathic, Web-spinning, Frilled neck, Camouflage, Sonic scream, Proboscis, Night vision, Exoskeleton, Hairy mane, Regeneration, Multiple eyes, Dorsal fins, Venomous, Glittering, Extra limbs, Shape-shifting, Elastic skin, Thorn-covered, Fire-breathing, Extra joints, Crystalline, Natural armour, Horns, Whiskers, Prehensile tail, Tusks, Dewclaws, Hypnotic gaze, Claws, Shell, Echolocation, Webbed feet, Paws, Acidic saliva, Hooves, Mane
