# SECTION 5: Government, Power & Law

Who holds power? How did they get it? What laws govern your world? These questions matter because political structures create the obstacles, stakes, and pressures that shape your characters' choices.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — How power actually works in your world. Forms of government, how laws are made and enforced, how political power intersects with magic. This is the political reality your characters live under regardless of their romantic situation.

**Part Two: Politics & Romance** — How political realities create romantic tension. Laws that forbid unions, arranged marriages, enemies across battle lines, the stakes of being caught. This builds on the foundation to show how your world's politics specifically affects your love story.

You need both.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question will apply to your story. **Skip what doesn't.**

**If politics is background, keep it simple.** Not every romantasy needs complex political intrigue. Develop just enough to make the world feel real.

**Politics can stay vague.** Some stories work better with political structures that are felt rather than detailed.

---

# PART ONE: THE FOUNDATION

---

## Forms of Government

Different political structures create different pressures, different power dynamics, and different possibilities for your characters.

### Government Types

**What form of government exists?**

| Type | How Power Works | Common Features |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Absolute Monarchy** | Single ruler with unchecked power | Succession crises, court intrigue, ruler's whim is law |
| **Constitutional Monarchy** | Ruler limited by laws/councils | Balance of power, competing factions, reform possible |
| **Feudal System** | Hierarchy of lords owing loyalty upward | Local power varies, divided loyalties, regional differences |
| **Theocracy** | Religious authority rules | Divine law, religious hierarchy holds power, heresy is treason |
| **Magocracy** | Magical power determines rule | Non-mages marginalized, magical bloodlines matter |
| **Oligarchy** | Small group holds power (nobles, merchants, mages) | Factional conflict, closed system, hard to break in |
| **Republic/Democracy** | Elected or representative rule | Popular opinion matters, elections as pressure points |
| **Empire** | Central power over conquered territories | Core vs. periphery, colonial dynamics, rebellion threats |
| **Tribal/Clan** | Power through kinship groups | Family loyalty paramount, inter-clan politics |
| **Council Rule** | Decisions by committee | Consensus needed, gridlock possible, coalition building |

Which describes your world?

**If your world has multiple nations, do they have different systems?**

### Current Rulers

**Who currently holds power?**

| Aspect | Details | Example (Serpent & Dove) |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Title/Position | | *The Archbishop — head of the Church, supreme authority on matters of faith and law* |
| Name | | *Archbishop Florin — Reid's adoptive father, the face of the witch hunts* |
| How they gained power | | *Rose through Church ranks, built his reputation on successful witch burnings, political maneuvering* |
| How long they've ruled | | *Two decades — long enough to shape an entire generation's beliefs about magic and witches* |

**What do they want?**

What are the current ruler's goals, fears, and priorities?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What threatens their rule?**

Every power structure has vulnerabilities:

## How Laws Work

Understanding how laws are made, changed, and enforced tells you what obstacles are truly immovable and which might bend.

**Who makes laws?**

Ruler by decree? Legislative body? Religious authority? Tradition that no one changes? Magical compulsion?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can laws be changed? How?**

| Method | How It Works | How Difficult |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Ruler's decree | | |
| Legislative process | | |
| Religious reinterpretation | | |
| Revolution/conquest | | |
| Legal challenge/appeal | | |

**Are there laws considered unchangeable?**

Divine law, ancient compacts, magically binding treaties — things that *cannot* be altered:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Law Enforcement & Justice

**Who enforces the law?**

| Enforcement Body | What They Handle | Who Controls Them |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**How effective is enforcement?**

Omnipresent and efficient? Corrupt and selective? Regional variation? Depends on who you are?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the justice system work?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who judges (monarch, courts, religious authority, trial by combat) | |
| Are there trials? | |
| Do the accused have rights? | |
| Can verdicts be appealed? | |
| Who can afford good representation? | |

**Is justice equal?**

Does class, wealth, species, or magical status affect how law applies? Be specific about who gets treated differently:

_______________________________________________________________

## Political Structure & Hierarchy

**What's the political hierarchy?**

Map it from highest to lowest power:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people move up (or down) in political power?**

Birth? Achievement? Magical ability? Wealth? Military service? Marriage?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What positions exist that matter for your story?**

| Position | Power They Hold | Who Currently Holds It |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Magic & Political Power

If magic exists, it interacts with political power. Who has magic affects who rules.

**How does magic relate to political authority?**

| Dynamic | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Mages rule (magocracy) | Political power comes from magical power |
| Mages serve | Government employs/conscripts mages |
| Mages are controlled | Laws restrict magic; mages are tracked/limited |
| Mages are separate | Magical and political authority are different spheres |
| Mages are persecuted | Magic is forbidden; mages are hunted |

Which describes your world?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who controls access to magical power?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| How is magic acquired (birth, training, divine gift, artifacts)? | |
| Who controls training/access? | |
| Can magical power be taken away? | |

**What laws govern magic use?**

What's forbidden? What's required? What's regulated?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Factions & Political Groups

Most political systems have competing factions — groups with different goals who struggle for power and influence.

**What major factions exist?**

| Faction | What They Want | Who Leads Them | Their Power Base |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**How do factions compete?**

Court intrigue? Elections? Military power? Economic pressure? Magical conflict?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there current factional conflict that affects your story?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## War & Military

**What's the current state of conflict?**

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Active war | Battles happening now |
| Cold war | Hostile but no open conflict |
| Fragile peace | War recently ended or imminent |
| Long peace | Generations without major conflict |
| Perpetual low-level conflict | Border skirmishes, raids, never resolved |

Which describes your world?

_______________________________________________________________

**Who are potential or actual enemies?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the military work?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who serves (volunteers, conscripts, nobility, mercenaries) | |
| How large is the military | |
| What's military service status (honored, feared, pitied) | |
| Are there magical military forces | |

# PART TWO: POLITICS & ROMANCE

---

## How to Think About Politics in Romantasy

Politics in romantasy functions as **external pressure** — forces beyond your characters' control that forbid, compel, or complicate their relationship. Unlike internal obstacles (fear, trust issues, personal history), political obstacles exist whether your characters want them to or not.

Political pressure works on romance in three ways:

### Politics as Prohibition

Laws and political structures that forbid the relationship:
- Marriage laws that make their union illegal
- Class systems that make their relationship scandalous
- Species laws that criminalize their love
- Political enemies who cannot be seen to fraternize

### Politics as Compulsion

Political forces that push characters together against their will:
- Arranged marriages for alliance or peace
- Political necessity requiring cooperation
- Shared enemies creating forced alliance
- Diplomatic situations demanding proximity

### Politics as Stakes

What characters risk by pursuing the relationship:
- Execution, imprisonment, exile for illegal unions
- Loss of title, inheritance, political position
- War, broken treaties, political chaos
- Harm to family, faction, or nation

The most compelling political obstacles are ones characters can't simply ignore or talk their way out of. The law doesn't care that they're in love. The war doesn't pause for their feelings. The political marriage is happening whether they want it or not.

---

## Common Patterns: Politics in Romantasy

### Political Situations That Create Romance

| Pattern | How It Works | What It Creates |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The forbidden union** | Law prohibits their marriage | Secrecy, risk, "us against the world" |
| **The arranged marriage** | Political necessity forces them together | Forced proximity, duty vs. desire |
| **The enemies** | Their peoples/factions are in conflict | Loyalty tested, betrayal required |
| **The political prize** | One is valuable for political marriage | Competition, commodification, rescue |
| **The hostage/ward** | One is held by the other's people | Power imbalance, Stockholm dynamics |
| **The succession crisis** | Their relationship affects who rules | High stakes, public scrutiny |
| **The peace treaty** | Their union could end a war | Pressure to perform, symbol vs. person |

### Political Character Pairings

| Pairing | Built-in Tension | Key Question |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Royal + Commoner** | Class law, succession, scandal | Can love override duty to bloodline? |
| **Enemy nations** | War, loyalty, treason | Can they choose each other over their people? |
| **Conqueror + Conquered** | Power imbalance, historical wrong | Can there be love without freedom? |
| **Political rivals** | Competing goals, zero-sum game | What would they sacrifice to win — or to love? |
| **Arranged spouses** | Obligation without choice | When does duty become desire? |
| **Guard + Protected** | Professional boundary, power difference | Can duty and love coexist? |

---

## Common Mistakes with Political Worldbuilding

### Mistake #1: The Toothless Law

**What it looks like:** There's a law against their relationship, but no one enforces it. They're "forbidden" but face no real consequences.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Forbidden love only matters if the forbidding has teeth.

**How to fix it:** Show enforcement. Someone else has been punished. Getting caught would mean concrete, serious consequences.

### Mistake #2: The Easily Escaped Arrangement

**What it looks like:** One character is in an arranged marriage, but they can simply refuse, or the other betrothed is cartoonishly evil so breaking the arrangement is obviously right.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Arranged marriage tension requires the arrangement to be genuinely binding.

**How to fix it:** Make the arrangement matter. Breaking it means war, family ruin, or personal destruction. Make the choice genuinely hard.

### Mistake #3: The Vague Politics

**What it looks like:** There's political conflict, but it's unclear what anyone wants, what the stakes are, or why it matters.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If readers don't understand the political situation, they can't feel the pressure.

**How to fix it:** Be specific. Who wants what? Why can't both sides have it? Ground the conflict in concrete goals and consequences.

### Mistake #4: The Politics That Pause for Romance

**What it looks like:** Serious political conflicts somehow stop mattering when the romance heats up. External pressure disappears when it's inconvenient.

**Why it hurts your romance:** It breaks immersion and makes stakes feel fake.

**How to fix it:** Politics should intensify during the romance, not pause. The pressure doesn't let up just because they're falling in love.

### Mistake #5: The Unearned Enemy-to-Lover

**What it looks like:** Characters are supposed to be enemies, but their enmity is based on misunderstanding or conflict that evaporates once they talk.

**Why it hurts your romance:** True enemies-to-lovers requires genuine enmity that must be overcome, not misunderstanding to be cleared up.

**How to fix it:** Build real reasons for enmity. Then make them reckon with that, not just discover they were wrong.

## Who Rules & How

**What form of government exists in your world?**

Common options: monarchy (absolute, constitutional, hereditary, elected), theocracy, magocracy, oligarchy, democracy, empire, feudal system, tribal confederation, council, or dual systems where magical and mundane authorities coexist.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who currently holds power?**

Be specific — name or title:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How did they gain power?**

This matters because it reveals what they fear losing:

Inheritance (fears other heirs, revolution), conquest (fears being conquered), election (fears losing support), magical strength (fears stronger mage), divine right (fears religious challengers), coup (fears the same), marriage alliance (fears spouse's family).

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do they maintain power?**

Military force? Magic? Religion? Economic control? Information and spies? Fear? Legitimacy and tradition?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What threatens their rule?**

Every power structure has cracks. Rival claimants? Popular unrest? External enemies? Succession crisis? Prophecy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does this instability affect your romance?**

Are your characters on opposite sides? Could their union stabilize or destabilize the realm? Would their relationship be used as a political weapon?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Power & Magic

If magic exists, it must affect politics. Who has magic affects who has power.

**Who controls access to magic?**

Is it hereditary (bloodlines hold power)? Learned (those controlling education hold power)? Granted by deities (those controlling access hold power)? Random (those who find and control magic-users hold power)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do mages rule, serve rulers, or oppose rulers?**

**Mages rule (magocracy):** How do non-mages fit in? What happens to weak mages?

**Mages serve:** Are they conscripted, employed, or enslaved? What happens to those who refuse?

**Mages are controlled:** What laws restrict magic? How are mages tracked or eliminated?

Which dynamic exists, and how does it affect your characters?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If one character has magic and the other doesn't, how does this affect their political standing?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could your characters' relationship threaten the magical power structure?**

Mixing bloodlines? Teaching forbidden magic? Creating a dangerous bond? Fulfilling or defying prophecy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Marriage Laws

In romantasy, marriage law is often the primary legal obstacle. Understanding what's legal, what's forbidden, and what the consequences are tells you exactly what your characters are up against.

Marriage laws exist for reasons — usually to preserve power structures, control inheritance, maintain class or species boundaries, or serve religious doctrine. Knowing *why* the law exists helps you understand how rigid it is and what challenging it would mean.

**Who can legally marry whom?**

Consider restrictions based on class, species, magical status, gender, family, religion, age, political status:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do these restrictions exist?**

Give a reason — even if it's a bad one. Magical danger? Political control? Religious doctrine? Maintaining class system? Historical catastrophe blamed on forbidden unions?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What makes a marriage legal and binding?**

Religious ceremony? Legal contract? Magical binding? Consummation? Public declaration? Parental consent? Royal approval?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can marriages be dissolved?**

Divorce allowed? Annulment possible? Magical bonds breakable? Or is marriage permanent?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What are the consequences of an illegal marriage?**

Criminal (execution, imprisonment, exile)? Social (loss of title, disownment)? Magical (loss of power, curse)? Political (loss of succession rights, treaty violation)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Class & Caste Systems

Class systems create some of romantasy's most enduring obstacles — the prince and the servant, the noble and the commoner. These systems work as romantic obstacles because they're structural, not personal.

What makes class gaps compelling is the different worldviews — the noble has never worried about where their next meal comes from; the servant has never had the luxury of boredom. These experiential gaps create misunderstanding, fascination, and friction.

Class shapes identity in ways that don't disappear when you fall in love. The servant who marries the prince doesn't stop being someone who grew up serving. The most interesting class-gap romances show characters navigating real gaps without pretending the worlds are the same.

**What social hierarchy exists?**

Map it from highest to lowest, including what determines class (birth, wealth, magic, achievement):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where do your characters fall?**

| Character | Class Position | Example (Serpent & Dove) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Protagonist | | *Witch (criminal class) — beneath even peasants in the eyes of law, hunted and killed on sight* |
| Love Interest | | *Chasseur Captain — military-religious elite, second only to the Archbishop, respected and feared* |

**How many ranks separate them?**

Same class? One or two apart (scandalous but navigable)? Extreme gap (servant/royal)?

_______________________________________________________________

**What laws enforce class separation?**

Restricted spaces? Forbidden interactions? What happens if someone acts "above their station"?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What social consequences exist for cross-class relationships?**

Loss of status? Disownment? Social isolation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Species & Race Laws

If multiple intelligent species exist, there are likely laws governing interaction. These laws often create the hardest obstacles — not just social disapproval but fundamental questions about whether such unions are even possible or recognized.

**What species exist in your world?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What legal restrictions exist between species?**

Intermarriage? Mixed-species children? Enslaved or second-class species? Segregated territories?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If your characters are different species, what laws affect them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Political Arrangements: Forced Together

Arranged marriages and political alliances are romantasy staples because they create forced proximity with high stakes. The characters didn't choose each other — but now they must deal with each other.

What makes arranged marriage compelling as a trope is the tension between obligation and desire. They're bound together by duty, politics, or necessity. The question becomes: can something real grow in soil that wasn't chosen?

**Is one or both characters in an arranged marriage or betrothal?**

If yes:

**Who arranged it and why?**

Family (for alliance, wealth, bloodline)? Ruler (for political stability)? Religious authority (fulfilling prophecy)? The characters themselves made a deal?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What makes the arrangement binding?**

Legal penalties? Magical oath? Political necessity? Family pressure? No alternative?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who is the arranged partner?**

Are they decent (potential ally), cruel (clear villain), in love with someone else too (shared predicament), or the actual love interest (arranged marriage to lovers)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if the arrangement is broken?**

War? Family ruin? Loss of protection? Magical backlash? Political chaos?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Already Bound: When Arrangement Is the Starting Point

Sometimes the arranged marriage isn't an obstacle to escape — it's the premise. They're already married. Now what?

This setup creates a different kind of tension. The legal barrier is already gone. They're bound. The obstacle is internal: learning to see each other as people rather than obligations, building trust where there was none, finding genuine feeling in a relationship that began as transaction.

**If your characters begin the story already bound by political marriage:**

**How long have they been married?**

Just wed? Months? Years of cold distance?

_______________________________________________________________

**What were the circumstances of the wedding?**

Did they meet before? Was one or both unwilling? Was there hope, dread, or resignation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's their relationship like at the start of the story?**

Strangers? Polite distance? Active hostility? Tentative curiosity?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does their marriage require of them publicly?**

Must they appear united? Produce an heir? Attend functions together? Share chambers?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What private boundaries have they established?**

Separate bedrooms? Limited conversation? Rules about what they will and won't share?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What begins to shift those boundaries?**

What event, conversation, or realization starts changing how they see each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the obstacle now — if they're already married?**

The legal barrier is gone, but what emotional, political, or personal barrier remains? Trust issues? One is in love with someone else? They're on opposite sides of a conflict? One holds a secret?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When does obligation become choice?**

At what point do they stay together because they want to, not because they must?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Political Marriages & Treaties

When a marriage serves political purposes, the couple becomes symbols as much as people. They're performing for nations, not just for themselves.

Being a political chess piece does something to a person. You learn that your value lies in what you can secure, not who you are. When two political pawns are married to each other, they share something no one else understands — or they resent seeing in each other a reminder of what they've lost.

The question that haunts political marriages is whether genuine feeling can grow in coerced soil. Would they have chosen each other if they'd had a choice? Sometimes the question never gets a satisfying answer, and they have to live with that uncertainty.

**Is your characters' relationship politically important?**

If yes:

**What political problem does their union solve?**

Ends a war? Unites rival houses? Fulfills prophecy? Secures resources?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who benefits from their union? Who's threatened by it?**

| Group | Benefit or Threat |
|-------|-------------------|
| Who wants them together | |
| Why | |
| Who wants them apart | |
| Why | |

**What happens if they refuse the political obligation?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does political pressure affect their emotional relationship?**

Do they resent being forced together? Does duty make intimacy feel less genuine? Do they fall in love despite the arrangement — or struggle to trust what they feel because of it?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Enforcement & Consequences

Laws mean nothing without enforcement. If your characters can break laws with no real risk, there are no stakes. The question isn't just "what's illegal?" but "what happens if they're caught?"

**Who enforces the law?**

Royal guard? City watch? Magical enforcers? Religious authorities? Secret police? Self-enforcing magical contracts?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How effective is enforcement?**

Omnipresent (high risk)? Moderate? Weak or corrupt (easy to evade)? Selective (depends who you are)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when your characters are caught?**

| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| First offense | |
| Caught together | |
| Marry illegally | |
| Produce children | |

---

## Unequal Justice

Laws often apply differently depending on who you are — one might face death while the other faces a slap on the wrist.

Asymmetric risk poisons relationships in subtle ways. When they say "let's take this risk together," they're not actually taking the same risk. The protected partner may not understand what the vulnerable one faces. The vulnerable partner is always calculating, always aware of what happens if they're caught.

For the protected partner who does understand, there's guilt. They benefit from a system that would destroy the person they love. The most honest relationships acknowledge this asymmetry openly.

**Are laws enforced equally, or does power matter?**

Does the noble face consequences, or only the commoner? Can the magical character escape while the non-magical suffers?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If one character risks everything while the other risks little, how do they navigate that?**

Does the protected character understand what the other faces? Do they try to shield them? Does the vulnerable character resent the inequality?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could the protected character sacrifice their protection for the other?**

Renounce their status? Confess to share punishment? What would that cost?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if only one of them were caught?**

Would the protected character let the other suffer alone? Would they come forward? Would they have the power to save them?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Diplomatic Protection & Special Status

Some positions grant immunity from normal laws — or make someone untouchable in ways that affect the relationship.

**Does either character have special legal status?**

Diplomatic immunity? Religious sanctuary? Royal protection? Magical immunity? Status as hostage or ward?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does this status affect what they can do — or what can be done to them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could their status protect the other character?**

Could marriage, alliance, or association extend protection to their partner?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could their status endanger the other character?**

Does being connected to them make their partner a target? Create political complications?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would they lose if they gave up their special status?**

Could they renounce it? At what cost?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Trials & Justice

**If caught, do your characters get a trial?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Who judges them?**

Monarch? Court? Religious authority? Magical council? Trial by combat?

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they appeal? Is there any legal recourse?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Who would or could defend them?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Factions & Opposition

Your couple doesn't exist in a vacuum. Political factions may support or oppose them based on how the relationship affects larger power struggles.

**What major factions exist?**

| Faction | Goal |
|---------|------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

**Where do your characters fall?**

| Character | Faction | Example (Fourth Wing) |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| Protagonist | | *Riders Quadrant — elite dragon-bonded warriors who protect Navarre* |
| Love Interest | | *Riders Quadrant (officially) — but secretly connected to those questioning leadership's lies* |

**Are they on the same side, opposite sides, or unaligned?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If on opposite sides, what would it take to betray their faction for each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Political Enemies

**Who has political reason to keep your characters apart?**

| Enemy | Position | What They Want | Why They Oppose | What They'll Do |
|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

## Political Allies

**Who supports your characters despite political opposition?**

| Ally | Position | Why They Help | What They Risk |
|------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

---

## Warfare & Military

War is the ultimate political pressure. It separates lovers, forces impossible loyalties, and puts characters on opposite sides. War also changes people — characters who have seen combat carry that experience into their relationships.

### The State of Conflict

**Is your world at war, at peace, or somewhere in between?**

- Active warfare (battles happening now)
- Cold war (hostility without open conflict)
- Fragile peace (war recently ended or about to begin)
- Long peace (generations without major conflict)
- Perpetual low-level conflict (border skirmishes, raids, never fully resolved)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If at war: who's fighting whom, and why?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If at peace: what threatens to break it? What tensions simmer beneath the surface?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the state of conflict affect daily life?**

Rationing? Curfews? Suspicion of outsiders? Refugees? Economic strain? Absent family members?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Military Service

**Who serves in the military?**

Volunteers? Conscripts? Nobility obligated to fight? Mercenaries? Magical warriors? A professional standing army?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is military service required?**

For whom? At what age? For how long? Can it be avoided — and how?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the social status of soldiers?**

Honored? Feared? Pitied? Looked down upon? Does it vary by rank?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is either of your characters in military service?**

If yes:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which character | |
| Role/rank | |
| Why they serve | |
| What they've seen or done | |

**If one character is a soldier, how does this affect the relationship?**

Absence and separation? PTSD and emotional distance? Skills that are attractive or frightening? Duty that conflicts with love?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Enemies Across Battle Lines

If your characters are on opposite sides of a war, their relationship is treason — choosing each other means betraying everything they were raised to believe in.

**Are your characters on opposite sides of a conflict?**

If yes:

| Aspect | Protagonist | Love Interest | Example (Serpent & Dove) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| What conflict | | | *The witch hunts — systematic persecution of magic users by the Church* |
| Their side | | | *She's a witch (hunted) / He's a Chasseur (hunter)* |

**What does each side believe about the other?**

Propaganda, stereotypes, justified grievances:

| Side | What They Believe About the Enemy | Example |
|------|----------------------------------|---------|
| Protagonist's side | | *Chasseurs are murderers who burn innocents; the Church is built on lies and hate* |
| Love interest's side | | *Witches are agents of darkness; their magic corrupts everything it touches; they must die for humanity to be safe* |

**What would each character's people say about them loving the enemy?**

Traitor? Spy? Corrupted? Foolish? Understandable but forbidden?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it take for them to choose each other over their side?**

What would they have to believe, learn, or experience?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could their relationship end the conflict — or make it worse?**

Does their union have political implications for the war?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Violence They Carry

War leaves marks that don't heal.

**Has either character killed in war?**

If yes:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Which character | |
| Circumstances | |
| How it affects them | |

**Has either character lost someone to the conflict?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Who was lost and how | |
| How it shapes them | |

**Is there blood between their peoples that can't be easily forgiven?**

Atrocities, massacres, betrayals during the conflict:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does one character bear responsibility (personally or ancestrally) for violence against the other's people?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do they navigate this?**

Can there be forgiveness? Understanding? Or is this wound too deep?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Desertion & Defection

**What happens to deserters in your world?**

Execution? Imprisonment? Exile? Branded? Hunted?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could either character desert or defect for the relationship?**

What would push them to it? What would they lose?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If one defects to the other's side, how are they received?**

Welcomed? Suspected? Used for information then discarded? Tested?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### War's End

**How might the conflict end?**

Victory for one side? Negotiated peace? Exhaustion? Outside intervention?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could your characters' relationship play a role in ending the conflict?**

Symbol of unity? Marriage alliance? Proof that peace is possible?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would peace cost?**

What would each side have to give up or accept?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**In peacetime, could they be together openly — or would old hatreds persist?**

_______________________________________________________________

## Enemies to Lovers: Building Genuine Enmity

"Enemies to lovers" is one of the most popular romance tropes — and one of the most frequently underbuilt. Too often, the "enemies" dislike each other for reasons that evaporate the moment attraction becomes undeniable.

Real enemies-to-lovers requires *worldbuilding* that creates genuine enmity. Not misunderstanding. Real, structural reasons why these two people should hate each other.

**Misunderstanding creates obstacles that dissolve once cleared up. Genuine enmity creates obstacles that require sacrifice, growth, or transformation to overcome.**

What makes enemies-to-lovers satisfying is watching two people reckon with real grievances, not discover they never had any.

### The Foundation: Why Are They Actually Enemies?

**Which of these creates the conflict between your characters?**

Check all that apply and note specifics:

☐ **Opposing sides of a war or conflict**
They or their peoples are literally trying to kill each other.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **Historical wrongs between their peoples**
One group harmed the other in ways that haven't been forgiven.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **Directly opposed goals**
What one wants requires destroying what the other wants.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **One has power over the other (and has used it)**
Master/slave, conqueror/conquered, oppressor/oppressed.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **One has personally harmed the other (or their loved ones)**
Not their peoples — them specifically. Direct personal injury.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **Fundamentally opposed beliefs or values**
What one considers moral, the other considers evil.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **Competition for something only one can have**
Throne, position, resource, territory — winner takes all.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

☐ **One represents the system that oppresses the other**
Even if they didn't create it, they benefit from and enforce it.

Specifics: ______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How many of these apply to your story?**

1: You have a foundation. Consider whether it's strong enough.
2-3: Good complexity. Multiple layers of conflict.
4+: Rich enmity, but make sure it's not insurmountable.

### The Legitimacy Test

**Could a reasonable person, knowing what your protagonist knows, hate your love interest?**

Not just dislike — *hate*. If the answer is no, your enmity isn't strong enough.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could a reasonable person, knowing what your love interest knows, hate your protagonist?**

Enemies to lovers works best when both have legitimate grievances.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Types of Political Enmity

**Historical Enemies**

Sometimes the conflict predates your characters — they inherited it.

**What historical wrong exists between their peoples?**

Conquest? Massacre? Betrayal? Enslavement? Theft of land or magic?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who did what to whom?**

Be specific. Vague "ancient grudge" isn't enough.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How recent is this history?**

Living memory? Grandparents' time? Centuries ago but never forgotten?

_______________________________________________________________

**What evidence of this history remains?**

Scars on the land, displaced peoples, stolen artifacts, suppressed culture, ongoing inequality?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does each character relate to this history?**

Do they feel personal guilt/grievance, or do they see it as "the past"?

| Character | Relationship to Historical Wrong |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

---

**Personal Enemies**

The most intense enmity: one has directly harmed the other.

**What did one character do to the other (or their loved ones)?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Was it intentional, justified (in their mind), or accidental?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the one who caused harm feel guilty, justified, or conflicted?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would justice look like to the wronged party?**

Death? Confession? Reparation? There's no path forward without addressing this.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can this harm actually be forgiven?**

Some things can't be — and pretending otherwise insults readers. If one killed the other's family, "sorry" doesn't cut it.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

**Ideological Enemies**

Sometimes they're enemies because they believe fundamentally different things about how the world should work.

**What does each character believe that the other finds repugnant?**

| Character | Belief the Other Finds Repugnant |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

**Why does each believe this?**

Not just "they were raised that way" — what experiences, evidence, or reasoning supports their view?

| Character | Reasoning Behind Their Belief |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

**Is either belief clearly wrong?**

If so, the story is about one character learning they were wrong — which is fine, but different from true ideological conflict.

If both views have merit, the story is about synthesis or accepting difference — more complex.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Path from Enemies to Lovers

The journey from enmity to love requires specific beats: the crack in assumptions, the glimpse of complexity, the understanding that doesn't mean agreement, the choice that costs something.

**The Crack in the Armor**

At some point, one character does something that doesn't fit the other's understanding of who they are.

**What does the love interest do that surprises the protagonist?**

An act of kindness, mercy, honor, or vulnerability they weren't expecting:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the protagonist explain this to themselves initially?**

Rationalize it? Distrust it? Assume ulterior motive?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the protagonist do that surprises the love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the love interest initially explain this?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

**Seeing Through Their Eyes**

The turning point in enemies-to-lovers is usually when one character genuinely understands the other's perspective — not agrees with it, but *understands* why they believe what they believe.

**What does the protagonist learn about why the love interest is the way they are?**

Not excuses — context. The experiences, pressures, or reasoning behind their position.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does this knowledge change the protagonist's view?**

They don't have to agree. But do they understand?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest learn about the protagonist's perspective?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does this change them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

**The Point of No Return**

At some point, each character has to choose the relationship over their "side." This is the real test.

**What does the protagonist do that their side would consider betrayal?**

Not just "has feelings" — an action that crosses a line.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this cost them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest do that their side would consider betrayal?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this cost them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Reckoning with the Enmity

At some point, they have to actually address the reason they were enemies. Not avoid it. Not "that's in the past." Actually talk about it.

**The Conversation That Has to Happen**

**What specifically needs to be addressed?**

The historical wrong, the personal injury, the ideological divide — name it:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who brings it up?**

The one who was wronged? The one who caused harm? Does it happen naturally or get forced?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does each character need to say?**

| Character | What They Need to Say |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

**What does each need to hear?**

| Character | What They Need to Hear |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

**Is there an apology? Is it sufficient?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there forgiveness? Is it earned?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

**What Can't Be Fixed**

Some harms can't be undone. Some losses are permanent. Good enemies-to-lovers acknowledges this.

**What damage from their enmity is permanent?**

Lives lost, time wasted, trust that can never be fully restored:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do they live with what can't be fixed?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there anything one can do to make amends — even if it can't undo the harm?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Stakes of Reconciliation

**If they choose each other, what does the protagonist lose?**

Community, family, identity, safety, purpose:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest lose?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are these losses worth it?**

The answer should be "yes, but barely" — the cost should be real enough that choosing each other means something.

_______________________________________________________________

### World Impact

**Does their relationship affect the larger conflict?**

Symbol of peace? Proof that reconciliation is possible? Catalyst for change? Or just two people who found each other despite everything?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do others react to their relationship?**

| Side | Reaction |
|------|----------|
| Protagonist's side | |
| Love interest's side | |

### Common Enemies-to-Lovers Pitfalls

Use this as a checklist to make sure your enmity is strong enough:

**Check: Is your enmity based primarily on misunderstanding?**

If clearing up one misunderstanding would dissolve the conflict, you don't have enemies-to-lovers — you have miscommunication romance. That's fine, but it's a different trope.

_______________________________________________________________

**Check: Does attraction make them forget their legitimate grievances?**

Enemies shouldn't stop being enemies just because they find each other hot. Physical attraction while maintaining genuine conflict is part of the tension.

_______________________________________________________________

**Check: Do they ever actually address the reason they were enemies?**

If they just fall in love and the conflict is never discussed, resolved, or reckoned with, the ending feels unearned.

_______________________________________________________________

**Check: Does falling in love make either character unrecognizable?**

They can change, but they shouldn't become entirely different people. The stern commander can soften without becoming a puppy.

_______________________________________________________________

## Succession & Heirs

If your characters are part of powerful families, succession affects the romance. Who they marry, whether they produce heirs, and what bloodlines they mix all have political consequences.

**What does each character stand to inherit?**

| Character | Inheritance |
|-----------|-------------|
| Protagonist | |
| Love Interest | |

**How does their relationship affect inheritance?**

Marrying wrong costs inheritance? They must marry to inherit? Their union combines inheritances?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is either expected to produce an heir?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | |
| What happens if they don't | |

**If they're different species or one is sterile, how does this affect heir requirements?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could their relationship cause or solve a succession crisis?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Revolution & Reform

Sometimes the system itself is the antagonist. The laws are unjust. The government is oppressive. The only way to be together is to change the world.

**Are there legal means to change the laws keeping them apart?**

Appealing for exception? Changing laws politically? Waiting for a new ruler? Finding loopholes?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If peaceful change is impossible, what would revolution look like?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Would your characters join or lead a revolution?**

What would push them from surviving the system to fighting it?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would they sacrifice to change the system?**

Safety? Family? Status? Each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's lost even if they win?**

Revolution isn't clean. Lives lost? Stability destroyed? Becoming what they fought?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Integration Check

| Question | Answer | Example (Serpent & Dove) |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| How does your government control, use, or fear magic? | | *The Church hunts and executes witches; magic is seen as demonic corruption; Chasseurs are the enforcement arm* |
| What magical law most affects your characters? | | *Witchcraft is a capital crime — she's guilty by birth, not action. Merely existing makes her an outlaw* |
| Could magic let them bypass political obstacles? If yes, why don't they? | | *She could enchant her way out, but it would prove she's a witch. Using magic to escape means proving she deserves to die* |
| Does government have magical enforcement (truth spells, tracking, binding oaths)? | | *Blessings that supposedly detect witches; holy ground that's meant to repel evil; none of it actually works, but belief in it is powerful* |

---

## The Core Political Obstacle

**In one sentence, what is the primary political obstacle keeping your characters apart?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How can this obstacle be overcome?**

- Changing who they are (gaining status, power, different identity)
- Changing the system (reform or revolution)
- Escaping the system (running away, exile)
- Accepting consequences (being together despite the cost)

Which path do your characters take?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When does the political obstacle force a choice?**

The crisis point when they can no longer avoid confronting it:

## Quick Reference: Political Stakes

| Element | Your World | Example (Serpent & Dove-style) |
|---------|------------|-------------------------------|
| The law(s) that forbid the romance | | *Witches are to be burned; she IS a witch. Their marriage itself is illegal.* |
| Consequences if caught | | *Execution for her; disgrace and exile for him as a witch-hunter who wed one* |
| Who enforces and how aggressively | | *The Church's Chasseurs — hunters trained from childhood to kill her kind* |
| Political enemy who opposes them | | *The Archbishop — his adoptive father, who will personally light the pyre* |
| Political ally who supports them | | *Fellow hunters who look the other way; witches who owe her debts* |
| State of conflict (war/peace) | | *Cold war — witches hide, hunters seek. Open war is brewing.* |
| Military obligations affecting the romance | | *He's sworn to hunt witches. She's promised to kill the Archbishop.* |
| Source of genuine enmity (if enemies-to-lovers) | | *His people burned her mother. Her people have killed hunters he loved.* |
| What each loses by choosing the other | | *She: her coven, her vengeance. He: his faith, his brothers, his identity.* |
| The political crisis point | | *Her identity is revealed publicly; he must choose who to betray.* |
| How it resolves | | *They break from both sides, forge something new that honors neither old loyalty.* |

## Final Thought: Politics Creates Real Stakes

Political worldbuilding in romantasy isn't about creating a realistic government — it's about creating meaningful obstacles that require growth, sacrifice, or systemic change to overcome.

If your characters can simply ignore the laws or wait for the problem to disappear, your political obstacles aren't strong enough. But if breaking the law means war, if being caught means death — now you have stakes worth writing about.

Build a government that says "no" — and then watch your characters fight like hell to prove it wrong. If they start as enemies, their path to love should require them to reckon with those reasons, not ignore them.

That's enemies-to-lovers readers remember: the one where the enemies were real, and so was the love.
