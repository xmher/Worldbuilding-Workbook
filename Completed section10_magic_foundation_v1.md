# SECTION 10: BUILDING YOUR MAGIC SYSTEM — THE FOUNDATION

Magic is often what makes a fantasy world feel like *fantasy*. But magic that can do anything is magic that means nothing. The most memorable magic systems have rules, costs, and limits—and those constraints are what make them interesting. When your character reaches for their power, we need to know what they're risking, what they're capable of, and what's completely beyond them.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — Where magic comes from, who can use it, how it works, what it costs, and what it cannot do. This is the mechanical reality of magic in your world, the rules that exist whether or not your characters are falling in love.

**Part Two: Magic & Romance** — How magic creates romantic tension, intimacy, and stakes. Power imbalances, magical bonds, the vulnerability of using magic in front of someone, and how the rules of your system specifically affect your love story.

You need both. A romance built on magical bonds needs a believable magic system underneath. A magic system needs to show how its rules actually affect your lovers — what they can and can't do for each other, what magic reveals or conceals, what it costs to love someone in a world where power is unequal.

One more thing before we dive in: magic in romantasy isn't just about battles and plot problems. It's also about *intimacy*—how your characters connect, what they hide from each other, what it means when they finally let someone see their power (or their vulnerability). As you build your system, keep one eye on how magic might bring your leads together or push them apart.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question in this section will apply to your story.

**If your magic system is already established, focus on gaps.** You may already know the basics. Use this section to identify what you haven't decided yet—especially the romantic implications you may not have considered.

**If magic isn't central to your romance, go lighter.** Some romantasy has magic as backdrop rather than engine. If that's your story, answer the foundational questions and skip the detailed mechanics. Focus on how magic affects your characters specifically.

**Hard magic vs. soft magic is a spectrum.** You don't need to explain everything to readers—but *you* should understand how your magic works so your story stays consistent. Decide how much your readers need to know versus how much you need to know.

**Come back later.** Magic systems often reveal themselves through writing. If you're not sure how something works yet, move on and return when your story shows you.

## How to Think About Magic in Romantasy

Magic in romantasy functions as a **power system** and an **intimacy system** simultaneously. It determines who has power over whom, what vulnerability looks like, and what connection is possible. The rules of your magic shape not just what characters can do, but what it *means* when they do it—especially for each other.

The key insight is that magic creates asymmetry. Someone has more power, different power, forbidden power, or no power at all. These asymmetries generate romantic tension: the powerful one who could destroy but chooses to protect, the powerless one who offers something magic can't provide, the equals whose powers clash or complement.

### The Magic-as-Intimacy Framework

When you're deciding which magical elements to develop in detail, consider how they create intimacy or prevent it:

**Vulnerability intimacy:** What about using magic makes characters vulnerable?
- Magic that requires lowered defenses or emotional openness
- Power that reveals what the user is feeling
- Abilities that can only be used when trusting someone else
- The exhaustion or exposure that follows magical exertion

**Revelation intimacy:** What does magic reveal that would otherwise stay hidden?
- Powers that show emotional state (color changes, aura fluctuations)
- Abilities that require honesty to function
- Magic that reveals truth or strips away pretense
- The self that emerges when power is used fully

**Connection intimacy:** What magical connections can exist between people?
- Bonds that link minds, emotions, or senses
- Magic that requires partnership to function
- Powers that complement or amplify each other
- The intimacy of sharing magical space or energy

**Cost intimacy:** What does it mean to pay magic's price for someone else?
- Suffering the cost so another doesn't have to
- Watching someone you love pay the price
- Sharing the cost between you
- The accumulated toll that love makes visible

### The "Power Imbalance" Principle

Almost every romantasy involves magical power imbalance—and that imbalance must be navigated for the romance to feel equal. Consider:

- **Who has more power?** Raw magical ability, political power from magic, knowledge of magical secrets?
- **What does the less powerful person bring?** Something the powerful one needs that isn't magical—perspective, grounding, challenge, humanity?
- **How is the imbalance addressed?** Does power shift? Does the relationship find balance despite imbalance? Does the powerful one deliberately limit themselves?

Ask: *By the end of the story, do both characters have meaningful power in the relationship—even if their magical power remains unequal?*

## Common Patterns: Magic in Romantasy

### How Magic Creates Romantic Tension

| Pattern | How It Works | What It Creates |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The power gap** | One character vastly outpowers the other magically | Tension over protection vs. autonomy; what the powerless one offers |
| **The forbidden power** | One character's magic is outlawed, feared, or despised | Secret-keeping; the risk of revelation; love despite what they are |
| **The magical bond** | Magic connects characters whether they chose it or not | Forced intimacy; the question of choice vs. fate; growing into the bond |
| **The complementary powers** | Their magic works better together than apart | Partnership; needing each other; the whole greater than parts |
| **The shared cost** | Magic's price can be split or transferred between them | Sacrifice; protection; the intimacy of suffering for each other |
| **The power revelation** | Showing true power means showing true self | Vulnerability; the moment of being fully seen; trust demonstrated |

### How Magic Differences Create Romantic Tension

| Difference | Conflict It Creates | Resolution Path |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Has magic vs. has none** | Can the powerful one see the mundane one as equal? Can the mundane one not feel lesser? | Finding what the non-magical one provides that magic cannot |
| **Celebrated vs. forbidden magic** | Society accepts one and reviles the other | Challenging assumptions; choosing each other over approval |
| **Same type, different power levels** | Direct comparison possible; hierarchy clear | The stronger learning from the weaker; power isn't everything |
| **Opposing magic types** | Their powers naturally conflict or cancel | Finding harmony; the tension of opposition; choosing not to fight |
| **Trained vs. wild magic** | One controls precisely; one erupts unpredictably | Teaching and learning; accepting chaos; valuing different approaches |

## Common Mistakes with Magic in Romantasy

### Mistake #1: The Limitless Love Interest

**What it looks like:** The love interest is incredibly powerful with no meaningful limitations. They can solve any problem, defeat any enemy, protect from any danger. Their power has no cost, no weakness, no situation where it fails.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Unlimited power removes stakes and makes the powerful character less interesting. If they can fix everything, why do they need the protagonist? What does the protagonist bring to a relationship with someone who needs nothing? And dramatically, invincible characters create no tension—we never fear for them.

**How to fix it:** Give power meaningful limits. Maybe they're powerful in one domain but helpless in another. Maybe their power has a cost that accumulates. Maybe there are specific situations—emotional, environmental, plot-relevant—where their magic fails. The most interesting powerful characters are powerful *and* vulnerable.

### Mistake #2: The Instant Magical Bond

**What it looks like:** Characters become magically bonded immediately upon meeting, with the bond providing instant intimacy, trust, or connection. The bond substitutes for relationship development—they're connected, so they're in love.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Bonds that create instant intimacy skip the work of building a relationship. If magic makes them trust each other immediately, we don't see them *earn* that trust. If the bond creates love, we don't believe in the love—it's compulsion, not choice. Readers want to watch relationships develop, not have them delivered pre-formed.

**How to fix it:** Make bonds a beginning, not an ending. The bond might create awareness, not understanding. It might force proximity without forcing intimacy. Characters might resist the bond, resent it, or misunderstand what it means. The bond creates conditions for relationship—the relationship still needs to be built.

### Mistake #3: The Convenient Magic

**What it looks like:** Magic works exactly as needed for each scene. It's powerful when impressive power is required, limited when limitations create drama, costly when cost matters and free when it doesn't. The rules seem to shift based on what the plot needs.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Inconsistent magic destroys trust. If readers can't rely on the rules, they can't feel genuine tension—they know magic will work however the author needs it to. Romantic stakes built on magical constraints collapse if those constraints are negotiable.

**How to fix it:** Establish rules and follow them. Write down what your magic can and can't do, what it costs, when it works and when it fails. Then stick to those rules even when it complicates your plot. The complications often generate better scenes than the conveniences would have.

### Mistake #4: The Meaningless Power Gap

**What it looks like:** One character is vastly more powerful than the other, but this never actually affects their relationship. The power imbalance is stated but not felt. The powerful one never accidentally intimidates, the less powerful one never feels lesser, and the disparity creates no actual tension.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Power imbalances are inherently tense—and that tension is good. When authors ignore the imbalance, they waste potential drama and make the relationship feel unrealistic. Real relationships between people with different levels of power require navigation—and that navigation is interesting.

**How to fix it:** Let the imbalance matter. The powerful one might struggle not to be overprotective. The less powerful one might resent feeling protected. Moments might occur where power accidentally intimidates, or where the power gap is uncomfortably visible. Working through these tensions strengthens the relationship.

### Mistake #5: The Forgotten Cost

**What it looks like:** Magic is established as having a cost, but characters rarely pay it. They cast major spells without consequence, use power constantly without exhaustion, and the stated costs only apply when it's dramatic. Otherwise, magic is essentially free.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Cost is what makes magical choices meaningful. If healing someone costs the healer nothing, healing is just a thing that happens. If healing costs pain, energy, or life-force, healing becomes sacrifice—becomes love made tangible. Costless magic is just a convenient tool; costly magic is a measure of what characters will give.

**How to fix it:** Enforce costs consistently. Every time magic is used, the cost is paid. Small magic, small cost. Large magic, large cost. Characters should make tactical decisions about when to use magic based on what they can afford to pay. The reader should always know that magic costs something.

## Reference: Types of Magic Systems

Magic doesn't have to mean spellcasting. Here are different approaches to inspire you—mix and match, or invent your own.

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Elemental** | Control over natural forces (fire, water, earth, air, etc.) | Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Priory of the Orange Tree |
| **Spellcasting/Incantation** | Words, gestures, or rituals produce specific effects | Harry Potter, The Name of the Wind |
| **Innate/Inborn Abilities** | Powers you're born with, often tied to bloodline or species | X-Men, Graceling, Ninth House |
| **Blood/Sacrifice Magic** | Power drawn from blood, pain, or giving something up | Blood and Ash series, Daughter of No Worlds |
| **Emotional/Will-Based** | Magic fueled by feelings, desire, or force of will | The Rage of Dragons, Green Lantern |
| **Bond-Based** | Magic tied to a connection with another being (familiar, dragon, mate) | Fourth Wing, His Dark Materials, Pern |
| **Artifact/Object-Based** | Power resides in objects, not people | Lord of the Rings, Howl's Moving Castle |
| **Transformation/Shifter** | Ability to change form—into animals, elements, other people | ACOTAR (shifting), Skin of the Sea |
| **Death/Necromancy** | Power over death, spirits, or the boundary between life and death | Gideon the Ninth, Sabriel |
| **Bargain/Contract Magic** | Power gained through deals, oaths, or binding agreements | ACOTAR (bargains), Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell |
| **Symbiotic/Parasitic** | Magic requires or is enhanced by another being | Venom, The Fifth Season |
| **Music/Art-Based** | Creation through song, art, or creative expression | Wintersong, The Singing Hills Cycle |
| **Knowledge/True Names** | Power comes from knowing the true nature of things | Earthsea, The Name of the Wind |
| **Psychic/Mental** | Mind-reading, telekinesis, projection, mental influence | Shatter Me series, Carrie |

**Which type(s) best describe your magic system?** You can combine multiple approaches.

## The Source

Every magic system has an origin—where the power actually comes from. This shapes everything else: who has access, how it's viewed by society, and what it costs to use. The source of magic often carries thematic weight—divine magic implies the gods' interest in mortal affairs; blood magic implies sacrifice is fundamental to power; innate magic implies some are simply born different.

For romance, the source creates potential connection or division. Characters might share a source, making them kindred. They might draw from opposing sources, creating fundamental conflict. Or one might have access to the source while the other doesn't, creating the core magical asymmetry of the relationship.

**Where does magic come from in your world?**

This could be: the gods or divine forces, the natural world (ley lines, elemental forces, the land itself), an internal source (bloodlines, souls, emotions), external objects (artifacts, crystals, runes), knowledge and study (spells, rituals, ancient texts), a bargain or bond (with spirits, demons, the fae, dragons), something unknown or mysterious.

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Is there a single source of magic, or multiple types with different origins?** If multiple, how do they interact—or conflict?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Can the source be depleted, corrupted, or cut off?** What happens if it is?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How do people in your world *explain* where magic comes from?** Is the truth different from what most believe?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: Could the source of magic connect your leads—or divide them?*

*Sometimes magic creates multiple layers of division—and not all of them are visible at first. In ACOTAR:* Feyre is human; Tamlin is High Fae. That's the obvious gap—she's mortal and powerless in his world, she'll age and die while he stays the same, and she can never fully belong to a realm that runs on magic she can't access. But there's also something he's not telling her. He's hiding something about why she's really there, and she can feel it—the evasions, the things he won't explain, the way everyone in his court seems to be waiting for something. The reader and protagonist experience the divide as a mystery: *why won't he tell me the truth?* The answer, when it comes, reframes everything.

*Or the division might be more straightforward:* Magic runs through noble bloodlines, and she's aristocracy while he's common-born and supposedly powerless—except he's developing abilities that shouldn't exist in someone like him, and if anyone finds out, she'll have to choose between her family and protecting his secret. Or: She draws power from the sun god while he's blessed by the moon goddess—their magic is strongest when the other's is weakest. Or: Her magic comes from a pact with spirits he's sworn to destroy.

**How might the source of magic affect your leads' relationship?**

## Who Can Use Magic

Not everyone has to be magical—and who *can* wield magic shapes everything from social structure to your protagonist's place in the world. The distribution of magical ability creates the power structure your romance exists within.

If magic is rare, magic users are exceptional—potentially privileged, potentially feared, certainly different. If magic is common, it's just part of life, and the romance exists in a world where everyone has some power. If magic is inherited, families and bloodlines matter; if it's learned, access to education matters; if it's random, fate has favorites.

**How common is magic in your world?**

Think about it as a spectrum: Can nearly everyone use some form of magic? Is it limited to certain bloodlines, species, or chosen ones? Can anyone learn it with enough training and resources? Is it vanishingly rare—one in a thousand, one in a million?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What determines whether someone can use magic?**

This could be: birth (bloodlines, species, being "chosen"), training and study, a triggering event (trauma, near-death, ritual), possession of an object or bond with a creature, random chance, a sacrifice or bargain made.

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Can magical ability be gained if you weren't born with it? Can it be lost or taken away?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**If magic is inherited, how does that affect families, dynasties, and marriages?** If it's learned, who controls access to that knowledge—and who's excluded?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: How does who can use magic affect the dynamic between your leads?*

*In Serpent & Dove:* Lou is a witch hiding her magic; Reid is a witch hunter sworn to kill her kind. It's not just that one has magic and one doesn't—it's that his entire identity is built on destroying what she is. She has to hide her true self every moment they're together, and he doesn't know that the woman he's falling for is exactly the thing he's been trained to hate. The question isn't just "who has power"—it's "what happens when he finds out?"

*Or the dynamic might play out differently:* He's the most powerful mage in a generation; she has no magic at all—but she's the only one willing to tell him the truth, and he's realized he needs someone who sees *him*, not his power. Or: They're both magical, but her abilities are celebrated while his are considered dark and forbidden—she's the kingdom's darling, and he's what mothers warn their children about. Or: She had magic once, before it was burned out of her as punishment; he's the one who did it, following orders he now regrets.

## How Magic Works

This is the mechanical heart of your system—the "physics" of magic. You don't need to explain everything to readers, but *you* should understand how it operates so your story stays consistent.

The process of using magic matters for romance because it often creates vulnerability. If magic requires concentration, the user is exposed during casting. If it requires emotional openness, using it reveals inner states. If it requires physical gestures or words, it can be interrupted or observed. The *how* of magic shapes what it means to use it in front of someone—and what it means to trust someone enough to do so.

**How does someone actually *do* magic?** What does the process look like?

This could involve: spoken words or incantations, physical gestures or movement, intense concentration or meditation, drawing symbols or runes, channeling through objects (wands, staffs, crystals), emotional states (rage, love, fear), rituals with specific components, physical contact or proximity, visualization or mental focus, music, dance, or artistic creation.

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What does magic look like when it happens?** What do bystanders see, hear, or feel?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How long does it take to use magic?** Can it be done instantly, or does it require preparation?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Can magic be interrupted?** What happens if it's disrupted mid-use?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Is magic precise or unpredictable?** Does the same action always produce the same result, or is there variation based on skill, emotion, or circumstance?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: Is there anything about how magic is performed that creates vulnerability or intimacy?*

*In Fourth Wing:* Dragon riders share a mental bond with their dragons—and sometimes with each other. Violet and Xaden can speak mind-to-mind, which sounds romantic until you realize it means he knows when she's scared, when she's lying, when she's thinking about him. There's nowhere to hide. The bond doesn't just connect them; it strips away the walls they've both built. Intimacy isn't a choice—it's a consequence of the magic, whether they're ready for it or not.

*Or vulnerability might come from the process itself:* Magic requires absolute focus, so she can only cast when she trusts someone to watch her back—and he's the first person she's trusted that much in years. Or: Power flows through touch, which means every time she heals him, she feels everything he feels—including what he feels about her. Or: His magic flares when his emotions are strong, so she always knows when she's affected him, no matter how cold he acts.

**How might the process of using magic create vulnerable or intimate moments between your leads?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

## The Cost

This is where your magic system gets genuinely interesting. Unlimited power is boring; power with a price creates drama. What does magic take from the user—and is it worth paying?

Cost is what makes magical choices meaningful. It transforms magic from a convenient tool into a measure of commitment. When a character heals someone at cost to themselves, that's not just magic—it's sacrifice. When they push past their limits for someone they love, the cost is proof of that love. And when the price is too high, choosing not to pay it reveals where lines are drawn.

**What does using magic cost?**

Common costs include: physical energy or exhaustion, pain or physical damage, shortened lifespan or accelerated aging, emotional toll (memories fade, feelings dull, sanity frays), rare materials or components consumed in use, time and extensive preparation, moral or spiritual cost (corruption, debt, loss of humanity), something taken from the world around them (heat, life, color).

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Does the cost scale with the power used?** Is a small spell a small price, while world-shaking magic demands everything?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What happens when someone overextends—uses more magic than they can safely handle?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Is the cost immediate, or does it accumulate over time?** Can someone use magic freely for years and then pay all at once?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Are there situational or plot-driven costs—times when magic *can't* be used safely even if the user has the power?**

*In ACOTAR:* Rhysand is immensely powerful, but for much of the story he has to limit his magic use because the enemy can track it. The cost isn't physical—it's tactical. Using his full power would reveal his location and endanger everyone he's protecting. This creates tension because we know he *could* solve problems with magic, but the situation won't let him.

Think about: Can magic be tracked, sensed, or traced? Are there times when using magic would alert enemies, break a cover, or violate a treaty? Does magic leave evidence? Are there political or social consequences for using certain powers?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Does your protagonist know the full cost of their power, or are they going to find out the hard way?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: How might the cost of magic create romantic tension or sacrifice?*

*In From Blood and Ash:* Poppy's gift lets her sense others' emotions and take away their pain—but it means absorbing that pain into herself. Every time she helps someone, she suffers for it. When she uses her power on Hawke, she's not just healing him; she's choosing to hurt for him. And he doesn't miss what it costs her. The magic creates a cycle: she gives, he sees, he tries to protect her from her own compassion, she resents being protected. Her power is a gift that looks like self-destruction.

*Or the cost might create different tensions:* His power is fueled by strong emotion, which means falling in love makes him more powerful but also more dangerous; the more he feels for her, the harder he is to control. Or: Magic costs memories, and she's been using so much power that she's starting to forget why she's fighting—including starting to forget him. Or: The price of his greatest spell was "the thing you love most," and he cast it before he met her, which means the debt is still waiting to be collected.

**How might the cost of magic create stakes in the relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

## The Limits

What magic *cannot* do is more important than what it can. Limits create stakes, force creativity, and prevent your characters from solving every problem with a wave of their hand.

Limits are what make magical choices interesting. If magic can do anything, there's no tension in using it. But if magic can do some things and not others—if there are genuine gaps in what power can accomplish—then those gaps become the spaces where story happens. The incurable illness, the unbreakable curse, the problem magic can't solve: these are where characters must find other resources.

**What is absolutely impossible with magic in your world?** Name at least three things magic cannot do.

Consider the reference table below, then write your answers:

1. ___________________________________________________________________________

2. ___________________________________________________________________________

3. ___________________________________________________________________________


### Reference: Types of Magic Limitations

Use this table to think through different ways to constrain magic in your world. Effective systems usually have multiple types of limitations working together.

| Limitation Type | Examples | Story Function |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| **Impossible Acts** | Can't raise the truly dead, can't create genuine love, can't time travel, can't grant true immortality, can't create something from nothing | Creates absolute stakes—some problems *must* be solved without magic |
| **Material Weaknesses** | Iron disrupts fae magic, silver harms werewolves, salt breaks enchantments, running water grounds power, certain stones block or absorb magic | Gives non-magical characters a fighting chance; creates vulnerability |
| **Environmental Limits** | Magic fails in certain locations (dead zones, holy ground), weakens at certain times (daylight, new moon), doesn't work underwater or underground | Controls where magic can solve problems; creates dangerous/safe spaces |
| **Physical State** | Can't use magic when exhausted, injured, sick, or emotionally compromised; requires clear focus or calm | Makes physical danger matter even to powerful magic users |
| **Knowledge/Skill Caps** | Must learn specific abilities, must understand something to affect it, years of training required for advanced magic | Justifies why powerful magic is rare; creates expertise hierarchies |
| **Resource Depletion** | Energy runs out and must recover, rare components consumed, limited uses per day/week, power waxes and wanes with external cycles | Creates tactical decisions; prevents unlimited magic use |
| **Backlash/Consequences** | Overuse causes damage, failed magic backfires, dark magic corrupts the user, power attracts dangerous attention | Makes every magical choice meaningful and risky |
| **Range and Scale** | Can only affect things you can see, touch, or name; power diminishes with distance; can't affect large areas or many targets | Keeps magic personal and tactical rather than world-breaking |
| **Countermeasures** | Other magic users can block or dispel, certain creatures are immune, wards and protections exist, magical "arms races" | Creates strategic depth and prevents any one power from dominating |
| **Social/Legal Limits** | Magic is illegal, regulated, taxed, or taboo; using certain powers marks you as criminal or outcast | Creates external conflict beyond the magic itself |
| **Specificity** | Fire mages can't do ice magic, healers can't harm, each person has only one gift, powers don't overlap | Requires teamwork and creates complementary character dynamics |
| **Consent/Will** | Can't affect someone who truly resists, can't read an unwilling mind, bargains require genuine agreement | Protects character agency; limits mental/emotional magic |

**Looking at this table, which limitation types exist in your system?** Check all that apply and note specifics:

☐ Impossible Acts: __________________________________________________________

☐ Material Weaknesses: ______________________________________________________

☐ Environmental Limits: _____________________________________________________

☐ Physical State: ___________________________________________________________

☐ Knowledge/Skill Caps: _____________________________________________________

**Are there things magic *can* technically do, but no one attempts because the cost or risk is too high?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Can magic be resisted or defended against?** How do non-magical people protect themselves?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: Do any of your limitations create romantic tension or complications?*

*In The Cruel Prince:* The Fae cannot lie. It sounds like a small rule, but it shapes everything. Cardan can't tell Jude a direct lie—so every cruel thing he says, she knows he means. And every rare moment of honesty hits harder because she knows it's true; he literally cannot say "I love you" unless he does. The limitation forces both of them to become masters of misdirection, half-truths, and lies of omission. When the truth finally comes, it's devastating precisely because neither of them can hide behind "I didn't mean it."

*Or limitations might create different complications:* Her magic doesn't work on anyone she loves, a limitation she discovers at the worst possible moment when she can't shield him from an attack. Or: Magic fails in iron, and his family's ancestral home is built with iron bones—she literally cannot be herself within his walls. Or: His shapeshifting doesn't fool people who truly know him, and she's the first person to see through every mask.

## Scale and Power

Not all magic users are created equal. Understanding the range of power in your world—from the weakest hedge witch to the most terrifying archmage—helps you place your characters and set stakes appropriately.

Power levels create hierarchy, and hierarchy creates tension. Where your characters fall on the power scale affects how they're treated by others and how they relate to each other. A romance between the most powerful mage alive and someone with a small, "useless" gift has different dynamics than a romance between equals.

**What's the range of magical power in your world?** Describe the *least* powerful magic user and the *most* powerful.

Weakest: _______________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

Strongest: _____________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Where do your protagonist and love interest fall on this scale?** Is there a significant gap between them?

Protagonist: ___________________________________________________________________

Love Interest: _________________________________________________________________

**Is raw power the only measure of magical strength, or can skill, creativity, knowledge, or cleverness make a "weaker" magic user formidable?**

**What's the most impressive feat of magic in your world's history or legend?** Could anyone alive today replicate it?

**Is magical power fixed, or can it grow?** How does someone become more powerful—and what do they risk in pursuing that growth?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: If there's a power gap between your leads, how do you balance the relationship?*

*In ACOTAR (later books):* Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in Prythian's history. Feyre starts as a human with nothing. But the story doesn't let that gap make her irrelevant—she gains power, yes, but more importantly, she has things he needs that have nothing to do with magic: she sees through his masks, she challenges his decisions, she refuses to be protected when she could be fighting beside him. He's spent centuries being the most powerful person in every room; she's the first person who treats him like a man instead of a weapon. Power isn't just magic—it's also who's willing to call you on your bullshit.

*Or you might balance the gap differently:* Her magic is small, almost useless: she can make plants grow slightly faster. But he's been poisoned with something that's slowly killing him, and her "useless" gift is the only thing keeping him alive long enough to find a cure. Or: She's powerful and he's not, but he's the one who grew up on the streets and knows how to survive when magic fails—in the dead zones, he's the one keeping her alive. Or: They're equals in power but opposites in type; neither could defeat the other, which is the only reason they're still talking instead of fighting.

**If there's a power gap, what does the less powerful person bring that the powerful one needs?**

## Types and Specializations

Some worlds have one kind of magic; others have many flavors. Understanding whether your magic is a single force or a diverse ecosystem affects how characters relate to their powers—and to each other.

When magic types exist, they create categories characters belong to. These categories might align (fire mages marry fire mages) or attract opposites (fire and water, light and dark). Types might create hierarchy (some magic is better) or complementarity (different types need each other). The magical landscape becomes a social landscape.

**Is magic in your world one unified force, or are there distinct types, schools, or disciplines?**

If there are distinct types, list them here:

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Do magic users specialize, or can someone master multiple types?** What determines their specialty—birth, choice, training, or something else?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Are some types of magic considered more valuable, dangerous, or taboo than others?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Do different types of magic interact?** Can they combine for greater effect, cancel each other out, or create unexpected reactions together?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

*Romantasy check: How do your leads' magic types interact?*

*In Gideon the Ninth:* Harrow is a necromancer—she works with bones and death. Gideon is her cavalier, a swordswoman with no magic at all. They're supposed to function as a unit: the necromancer does the magic, the cavalier does the fighting and provides... something else. The whole system is built on the idea that these two types need each other, that a necromancer without a cavalier is incomplete. But Harrow and Gideon hate each other. The magic demands partnership; their history demands distance. The tension isn't about their powers clashing—it's about two people who are magically designed to be partners but emotionally unable to trust each other.

*Or the interaction might be more direct:* His fire and her ice should be opposites, but when their powers touch, they create something neither can make alone: a mist that hides armies, a steam that powers engines, a balance that shouldn't be possible. Or: They have the same type of magic, which means they can feel each other casting—every spell she does, he feels like a tug in his chest, and he hates that she knows when he's using his power because she can feel him too. Or: Her magic amplifies whatever it touches, and she's terrified to touch him because she doesn't know if she'd make him stronger or burn him out entirely.

**How might your leads' types of magic interact—for good or ill?**

## Hard Magic vs. Soft Magic: Where Does Your System Land?

Now that you've built your system, let's step back and look at it as a whole. Magic systems exist on a spectrum between "hard" and "soft"—and knowing where yours falls helps you use it effectively.

**Hard Magic** has clearly defined rules, costs, and limitations. Readers understand what magic can and can't do, so when a character solves a problem with magic, it feels earned—we saw the tools, we understand the constraints. Hard magic is satisfying for problem-solving plots.

*Examples: Mistborn (specific metals grant specific powers), Fullmetal Alchemist (equivalent exchange), The Name of the Wind (sympathy follows strict rules)*

**Soft Magic** is mysterious, atmospheric, and not fully explained. It creates wonder and danger because we *don't* know its limits. Soft magic works best for creating mood, establishing threat, or showing that some things are beyond mortal understanding. The risk: if you solve major plot problems with undefined magic, it can feel like cheating.

*Examples: Lord of the Rings (Gandalf's magic is vague and wondrous), Game of Thrones (blood magic, the Others—mysterious and unpredictable), Uprooted (the Wood's corruption)*

**Most romantasy falls somewhere in between**—defined enough that readers understand stakes, mysterious enough to feel magical. You might have clear rules for everyday magic but unknowable forces at the edges of the world.

Looking at what you've built, where does your magic fall?

HARD ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ SOFT
(Clear rules,                                    (Mysterious,
readers understand                               wonder and
how it works)                                    danger)

**If your magic is on the harder side:** Have you established the rules clearly enough that readers will accept magical solutions?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**If your magic is on the softer side:** Are you avoiding using vague magic to solve major plot problems?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**If you're in the middle:** Which elements are rule-bound and which are mysterious? Is there a clear line between them?

## Magic Through Your Story's Structure

Let's look at how magic functions at each major story beat.

### Act 1: Setup — The Inciting Incident

How does magic launch your protagonist into the story?

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre kills a faerie—a magical creature—in the woods. She doesn't fully understand what she's done, but magic makes the kill possible and magic brings the consequences: Tamlin arrives to claim her life or take her to his realm. The inciting incident isn't just "something happens"; it's "something magical happens that she can't undo."

**What magical event, ability, or consequence pulls your protagonist out of their ordinary world?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How does this same magical event connect them to the love interest?** (In romantasy, the fantasy inciting incident and the meet-cute should be linked.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

### Act 2: Rising Action — Building Tension

How does magic complicate the growing relationship?

*In ACOTAR:* As Feyre spends time in the Spring Court, she's surrounded by magic she doesn't understand and can't use. Every beautiful thing—the food, the music, the immortality—reminds her that she doesn't belong. Meanwhile, the curse (which she doesn't know about yet) is ticking down, adding urgency that Tamlin can't explain. Magic isn't just backdrop; it's pressure.

**What magical obstacles, revelations, or complications arise as your leads grow closer?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Does magic create intimacy (shared power, training together, magical bonds forming) or distance (secrets, power imbalances, dangerous abilities)?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

### Act 3: Crisis — Everything Falls Apart

How does magic contribute to the "dark night of the soul"?

*In ACOTAR:* The curse breaks—sort of. Feyre says she loves Tamlin, but it's not enough, and Amarantha takes them all Under the Mountain. Magic becomes a prison: Feyre is powerless among the most powerful beings in the world, Tamlin is bound and can't help her, and the trials she faces are magical torments designed to destroy her. The very magic that drew them together now seems to make saving each other impossible.

**What magical crisis makes everything seem hopeless?** How does magic trap, separate, or endanger your leads at their lowest point?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

### Act 4: Resolution — The Climax

How does magic enable the resolution—and how is the romantic resolution tied to the magical one?

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre solves Amarantha's riddle (a magical test), and the answer itself is "love." Her willingness to die for Tamlin breaks the curse. But she does die—and is resurrected by the High Lords' magic, transformed into something new. The romantic sacrifice (dying for him) triggers the magical solution (breaking the curse), which transforms her (she becomes Fae). The romantic climax IS the magical climax.

**How does your protagonist's romantic choice enable the magical resolution?** How does resolving the magical conflict require them to also resolve their emotional journey?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What is your protagonist's magical state at the end versus the beginning?** Have they gained power, lost it, transformed, or learned to use it differently?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Magic and Your World

We'll dig deeper into magic's effects on society, economy, and politics in later sections. For now, note your initial thoughts:

**How has magic shaped the power structures in your world?** Who's on top because of magic—and who's at the bottom?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What do non-magical people think of magic users?** Fear? Reverence? Resentment? Envy? Exploitation?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Magic and the Relationship

This is romantasy, so let's get specific about how your magic system affects the relationship at the heart of your story.

**Does your magic system include any bonds, bargains, or connections between people?** (Soul bonds, mating marks, magical contracts, shared power?) If so, describe them:

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**If you have magical bonds: Are they chosen or fated?** Can they be broken? What does your story say about destiny vs. choice?

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How might magic create obstacles between your leads?**

Consider: forbidden types of magic, power imbalances, magic that makes trust difficult (mind reading, illusion, shapeshifting), duties or costs that pull them apart, being on opposite sides of a magical conflict.

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How might magic create connection between your leads?**

Consider: shared abilities or training, one can help/heal/protect the other, magical communication when apart, complementary powers, moments where using magic together creates intimacy.

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What would it mean for your protagonist to use their magic *for* their love interest—not in battle, but in a personal, private way?** (This doesn't have to be romantic yet—maybe it's protective, or generous, or reveals something they usually hide.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What would it mean for your protagonist to use their magic *in front of* their love interest in a way they don't show others—revealing their full power, their vulnerability, or a secret aspect of their abilities?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Consistency Check

Before you move on, let's make sure your magic system holds together.

**Write out your magic system in two or three sentences—source, who can use it, how it works, main cost, biggest limit:**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Does your magic system contradict itself anywhere?** (For example: "Magic is extremely rare" but also "Every noble family has a court mage.")

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Think of the biggest problem your protagonist faces. If a skeptical reader asked "Why didn't they just use magic to fix that?"—what's your answer?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What's one thing you're still unsure about in your magic system?** (Write it down—you may figure it out as you draft, or in later sections.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

## Final Thought: Magic Is Meaning

Magic in romantasy isn't just a tool—it's a language. It tells us who has power and who doesn't. It creates vulnerability by having costs and limits. It builds intimacy through shared abilities, bonds, and the choice to use power for someone else.

Build a magic system with clear rules and real constraints:
- Costs make sacrifice meaningful
- Limits make choices matter
- Power gaps create dynamics to navigate
- Magical bonds can accelerate intimacy but shouldn't replace relationship development

The best romantasy magic isn't about impressive power displays. It's about what magic *reveals*—about characters, about relationships, about what people will do for love.

Don't just give your characters magic. Give them magic that costs something, that reveals something, that connects them or divides them.

Make magic matter to the relationship, not just to the plot.
