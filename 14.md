# SECTION 14: Institutions & Structures

Institutions aren't just settings — they're systems designed to control, rank, test, and bind people. In romantasy, the right institution becomes a pressure cooker: it forces your characters into proximity, creates hierarchies they must navigate, and establishes consequences that make leaving impossible or dangerous.

The beauty of institutional settings is that they come with built-in rules, schedules, and power structures. Characters can't just walk away from an academy mid-semester or abandon a military post during wartime. The institution creates the container; your job is to make sure that container compresses your characters together.

This section builds on the political structures from Section 5 (Government), the cultural expectations from Section 3 (Culture), and the economic bindings from Section 4 (Economy). Here, we focus on how specific institutions function as romantic pressure systems.

## Types of Institutional Settings

Institutions come in many forms. Some stories use a single institution; others combine elements. Before diving into specifics, identify what type of institution shapes your story:

**Primary institution type:**

☐ Academy/Training Ground (education, magical training, warrior school)

☐ Court/Palace (political center, noble society)

☐ Military/Wartime (army, navy, resistance, occupation)

☐ Religious Order (temple, monastery, priesthood)

☐ Economic/Labor (guild, apprenticeship, debt bondage, employment)

☐ Healing/Care (hospital, asylum, recovery)

☐ Arranged Marriage (political alliance, forced union)

☐ Hybrid (combines multiple types — specify below)

**If hybrid, what elements combine?**

Example: A military academy combines military structure with educational setting. A temple that trains warrior-priests combines religious and military. A royal court with magical rankings combines court politics with magical hierarchy.

## The Academy/Training Ground

The academy setting is romantasy gold because it combines forced proximity, competitive rankings, and high stakes in one package.

### Why Academies Work

**What kind of academy is it?**

Magical training, military school, assassin academy, scholarly institution, religious education, craft guild school?

_______________________________________________________________

**What makes your academy dangerous or high-stakes?**

Deadly trials? Brutal competition? Magical dangers? Political intrigue? Secrets that could kill?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long do students stay?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Can students leave? What happens if they try to quit?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Ranking System

**Does your academy have rankings? What determines rank?**

Physical prowess, magical power, test scores, combat victories, political connections, instructor favor?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do top-ranked students get? What happens to those at the bottom?**

Privileges at the top: _____________________________________________

Consequences at the bottom: _______________________________________

**How does ranking create tension between your characters?**

Competing for the same spot? One at top, one struggling? Must choose between winning and helping each other? Assigned as partners despite rivalry?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Living Arrangements

**Where do students sleep? How much privacy exists?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What daily routines force interaction?**

Communal meals, training, shared bathing, curfews, inspections, study groups:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What rules govern relationships between students?**

Forbidden entirely? Forbidden between certain ranks? Allowed but discouraged? Punishable how?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Authority & Mentorship

**Who runs the academy? What power do instructors have over students?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a mentor figure who might help or hinder the relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if an instructor discovered the relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Courts & Palaces

Court settings trade physical danger for social danger. Every word is scrutinized, every glance noted. Courts are excellent for slow-burn because intimacy must be stolen in brief moments.

(Note: For the political structure of courts, see Section 5. Here we focus on court as a romantic pressure cooker.)

### Why Courts Work

**What makes your court dangerous?**

Political assassination, social ruin, blackmail, magical surveillance, loss of favor, imprisonment?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who watches everyone, and why?**

Spies, rivals, servants who report, magical surveillance, gossips:

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were seen together inappropriately?**

What defines "inappropriate" — private conversation? Touching? Being alone? Dancing too often?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Court Hierarchy

**Where does each character rank in the court hierarchy?**

(Reference Section 5 for class structures)

Protagonist's position: ____________________________________________

Love interest's position: __________________________________________

**What spaces can each access? Where would they naturally encounter each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where could they have a truly private conversation?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Court Customs

**What rituals force interaction between people who'd otherwise avoid each other?**

(Reference Section 3 for cultural customs)

Dances, ceremonies, negotiations, festivals, religious observances, political marriages:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How could they use customs to steal intimacy while appearing to follow rules?**

The dance that allows touch, the ceremony that requires standing close, the negotiation that puts them in the same room:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Factions & Reputation

**What factions exist? Which side is each character on?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would each lose if the relationship became public?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the threat of exposure used against them?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Military & War Settings

War accelerates everything. The threat of death strips away pretense, and "we might die tomorrow" becomes catalyst for intimacy.

(Note: For warfare's political dimensions, see Section 5. Here we focus on military settings as romantic pressure cookers.)

### Why War Works

**What conflict is your world engaged in?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How imminent is the danger?**

Cold war (tension, espionage) or active combat (battles, sieges)?

_______________________________________________________________

**What does "we might die tomorrow" actually mean for them?**

Is death a real possibility they face? How does this urgency affect what they're willing to say or do?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Military Structure

**What's each character's role?**

Soldier, commander, medic, strategist, prisoner, spy, conscript, mercenary, support staff?

Love interest: ___________________________________________________

**What rules govern relationships between ranks?**

Forbidden between officers and enlisted? Required to report relationships? Subject to reassignment?

_______________________________________________________________

**What if their relationship interfered with the mission?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Forced Proximity in War

**Where do soldiers sleep, eat, recover?**

Barracks, tents, ships, field camps — what privacy exists?

_______________________________________________________________

**What situation forces them to rely on each other for survival?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What injury might one tend for the other?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Opposite Sides

**If they're on opposing sides, what brought them into contact?**

Capture, neutral ground, secret negotiations, undercover work, chance meeting?

_______________________________________________________________

**What information does each have that could harm the other's side?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would each sacrifice to be together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**At what point does love become treason?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Religious Institutions

Temples, monasteries, and religious orders create unique pressure: vows that conflict with desire, sacred duties that demand sacrifice, communities where devotion is expected to eclipse personal attachment.

(Note: For religious doctrine and beliefs, see Section 6. Here we focus on religious institutions as romantic pressure cookers.)

### The Religious Setting

**What religious institution are your characters part of or connected to?**

Temple, monastery, convent, religious order, pilgrimage site, sacred academy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What is the institution's stated purpose?**

Training priests? Preserving knowledge? Serving a deity? Healing? Protection? Isolation from the world?

_______________________________________________________________

**What vows or commitments does the institution require?**

Celibacy, obedience, poverty, silence, service, separation from family, renunciation of former identity?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Religious Conflict with Love

**Does either character have vows that conflict with the relationship?**

What vows: _____________________________________________________

What breaking them would mean (spiritually, socially, practically): _________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the relationship forbidden, or just complicated by religious duty?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would the institution do if the relationship were discovered?**

Expulsion? Punishment? Forced separation? Loss of position? Trial? Worse?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Faith & Desire

**Does either character struggle between faith and feeling?**

How do they reconcile (or fail to reconcile) devotion and desire?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a way to have both — the relationship and their faith?**

Or must they choose? (Reference Section 6 for how religion might adapt or condemn)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Economic & Labor Institutions

Guilds, apprenticeships, indentured service, and debt bondage create obligation that binds as tightly as any lock.

(Note: For economic systems generally, see Section 4. Here we focus on how economic institutions trap characters together.)

### The Economic Binding

**What economic institution binds your characters?**

Guild membership, apprenticeship, indentured service, debt bondage, employment contract, family business obligation, trade partnership?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why can't they simply leave?**

Debt that must be repaid? Contract with penalties? No other options? Would lose everything they've worked for? Legal consequences?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long are they bound?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Economic Hierarchy

**What's the power structure?**

Master and apprentice? Employer and worker? Creditor and debtor? Guild ranks? Business partners with unequal stakes?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If there's a power imbalance, how does it affect the relationship?**

Can they be equals, or does one have power over the other's livelihood? (Reference Section 4 for economic power dynamics)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Loss of position, scandal, accusations of favoritism, contract violation, guild expulsion?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Healing & Care Institutions

Hospitals, asylums, and recovery spaces create vulnerability by design. One person is weak; the other provides care. The intimacy of illness and healing is unique.

### The Care Setting

**What healing institution is involved?**

Hospital, field medical tent, asylum, magical healing center, quarantine, recovery house, private sickroom?

_______________________________________________________________

**Why is one character there?**

Injury, illness, magical affliction, mental health crisis, recovery from trauma, curse, poison?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the other character's role?**

Healer, fellow patient, visitor, guard, staff, reluctant caretaker?

_______________________________________________________________

### Vulnerability & Intimacy

**What makes the patient vulnerable?**

Physical weakness, dependence, loss of privacy, inability to leave, altered mental state, need for constant care?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimate care creates connection?**

Feeding, bathing, wound care, sitting vigil, sharing confined space, witnessing pain, providing comfort?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the power imbalance of caregiver/patient affect the relationship?**

Can genuine connection form when one is so vulnerable? Does the dynamic shift when recovery happens?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Recovery & Change

**How does the patient change during recovery?**

What does the caregiver witness? What do they learn about each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when recovery is complete?**

Does the connection survive when vulnerability ends? Does the relationship need to be rebuilt as equals?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Arranged Marriages & Political Alliances

The arranged marriage forces intimacy before trust. Strangers must navigate domesticity, physical closeness, and political pressure simultaneously.

(Note: For marriage laws and customs, see Sections 3 and 5. Here we focus on arranged marriage as a romantic pressure cooker.)

### The Arrangement

**Why is this marriage happening?**

Peace treaty, alliance, joining bloodlines, claiming territory, preventing war, magical necessity, fulfilling prophecy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who arranged it? Do the characters have any say?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if they refuse?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Binding

**What makes the marriage unbreakable?**

Legal contract, magical binding, political treaty, religious vow, family honor?

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they live separately, or must they cohabitate?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimacy is expected?**

Public appearances, shared household, producing heirs, consummation, presenting a united front?

_______________________________________________________________

### Starting Point

**Does the story begin before or after the marriage?**

Before — the arrangement is an obstacle to escape or accept.
After — they're already bound and must learn to live together.

_______________________________________________________________

**If already married, what's their relationship like at the start?**

Strangers? Cold distance? Active hostility? Tentative curiosity? Grudging respect?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What begins to shift how they see each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Navigating Strangers-to-Lovers

**What preconceptions does each have about the other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the first thing that surprises them?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What domestic situation forces vulnerability?**

Sharing a bedroom, seeing each other sick, navigating servants who report everything, facing a crisis together?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### External Pressure

**Who wants this marriage to succeed? Who wants it to fail?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What public performance is required?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens behind closed doors when performance ends?**

_______________________________________________________________

## Institutional Ideals vs. Reality

Every institution claims to serve a purpose. The gap between what it claims and what it does creates story opportunity.

**What does your institution claim to do?**

The stated mission, the noble purpose, what it tells the world:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does it actually do?**

The reality beneath the ideal — control, exploitation, preservation of power, something darker?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters believe in the institution's stated purpose?**

Are they idealists who believe in the mission? Cynics who see the truth? One of each? Do their views change?

Protagonist: _____________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Love interest: ____________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when they see behind the curtain?**

When the gap between ideal and reality becomes undeniable:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does disillusionment bring them together or create conflict?**

Do they bond over shared revelation? Or does one still believe while the other has lost faith?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Gaming the System

Every institution has people who know how to work it — and people who suffer under it.

**Who benefits from this institution?**

Who has power, comfort, advantage within the system?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who suffers under it?**

Who is exploited, trapped, disadvantaged by the system?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where are your characters in this hierarchy?**

Are they beneficiaries, victims, or somewhere in between? Do their positions differ?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who knows how to game the system?**

Someone who knows the loopholes, who to bribe, how to bend rules:

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters learn to work the system?**

Do they find ways around the rules? Use the institution against itself?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there corruption they could exploit — or that threatens them?**

Bribes, favoritism, blackmail, secret deals, people who can be bought:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Diagnostic Question

For whatever institution you've chosen:

**If my characters tried to walk away right now, what would stop them?**

If the answer is "nothing" or "they'd feel bad," your institution doesn't have enough grip.

**Strong answers sound like:**
- They'd be executed for desertion
- The magical bond would kill them both
- Their families would go to war
- They'd lose their only chance at survival/power/freedom
- The enemy would capture them immediately
- They'd be stripped of their magic and exiled
- Their people would be slaughtered without the alliance
- They'd be hunted as oath-breakers

**Weak answers sound like:**
- They'd feel guilty
- It would be awkward
- Someone might be disappointed

**What is that cost in your story?**

## Final Thought: The Institution Is a Character

The best institutional settings feel alive — with their own rules, culture, corruption, and demands. The institution should press on your characters constantly, shaping what they can do, say, and feel.

Characters don't just exist within institutions; they're shaped by them, rebel against them, find cracks in them, and ultimately either escape them or change them.

Design an institution with enough grip that your characters can't just walk away — and then watch them try anyway. The institution creates the pressure; your characters' responses reveal who they really are.
