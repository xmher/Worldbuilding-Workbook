# SECTION 14: Institutions & Structures

Institutions aren't just settings — they're systems designed to control, rank, test, and bind people. In romantasy, the right institution becomes a pressure cooker: it forces your characters into proximity, creates hierarchies they must navigate, and establishes consequences that make leaving impossible or dangerous.

The beauty of institutional settings is that they come with built-in rules, schedules, and power structures. Characters can't just walk away from an academy mid-semester or abandon a military post during wartime. The institution creates the container; your job is to make sure that container compresses your characters together.

This section builds on the political structures from Section 5 (Government), the cultural expectations from Section 3 (Culture), and the economic bindings from Section 4 (Economy). Here, we focus on how specific institutions function as romantic pressure systems.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every story needs an institutional setting.

**If your romance happens outside institutions, that's fine.** Many excellent romances occur in domestic spaces, during journeys, or in settings without formal structure. Institutions are powerful tools, not requirements.

**You might use multiple institutions.** A character might move from academy to court to military camp. Each institution creates different pressure.

**Institutions can be background or foreground.** The institution might be the main setting (an academy romance) or context that affects the romance (court politics surrounding a relationship). Both work.

---

## How to Think About Institutions in Romantasy

Institutions create romantic pressure because they're systems of control that don't care about your characters' feelings. The academy doesn't care that they're falling in love — it cares about rankings. The military doesn't care about their chemistry — it cares about the mission. The court doesn't care about their connection — it cares about political advantage.

This indifference is the source of tension. The institution has its own priorities, and romance interferes with them. Characters must navigate systems that actively work against their personal happiness — or find cracks in those systems where connection becomes possible.

### The Institution-as-Obstacle Framework

Effective institutional settings work against romance in specific ways:

**Rules that prohibit:** The institution has explicit rules that make the relationship difficult or forbidden. Fraternization policies, rank prohibitions, vows of celibacy, arranged marriage obligations.

**Hierarchies that complicate:** The institution places characters at different levels of power, creating imbalance they must navigate. Instructor/student, officer/enlisted, master/servant, noble/commoner.

**Surveillance that exposes:** The institution watches its members, making privacy scarce and discovery dangerous. Spies, gossips, magical monitoring, shared quarters.

**Stakes that bind:** The institution creates consequences for leaving that trap characters within it. Desertion is death, expulsion is ruin, breaking contract means debt bondage.

### The "Gap Between Ideal and Reality" Principle

Every institution claims to serve a noble purpose. The gap between that claim and the reality is where story lives. The academy claims to train heroes but creates broken weapons. The court claims to serve the realm but serves only power. The temple claims to honor the gods but honors only control.

This gap creates:
- **Disillusionment:** Characters discover the institution isn't what it claims
- **Moral complexity:** Characters must navigate systems they've stopped believing in
- **Bond through revelation:** Shared disillusionment can bring characters together
- **Choice:** Characters must decide whether to reform, escape, or accept the institution

## Common Patterns: Institutional Romances

### How Institutions Create Romantic Tension

| Pattern | How It Works | What It Creates |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The forbidden relationship** | Institution explicitly prohibits their connection | Secret romance; risk of discovery; stolen moments |
| **The rival partners** | Competition for the same position/prize | Tension between attraction and ambition |
| **The assigned bond** | Forced into partnership they didn't choose | Must work together; resentment becoming respect becoming more |
| **The ranking divide** | Different levels of institutional hierarchy | Power imbalance; inappropriate connection; "what would people say" |
| **The shared secret** | Both discover something about the institution | Conspiracy creates intimacy; shared knowledge binds |
| **The escape plan** | Both want out; need each other to succeed | Alliance becomes attraction; survival romance |

### Institution Types and Their Romantic Functions

| Institution Type | Primary Pressure | Key Dynamic |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Academy** | Competition, ranking, survival | Rivals to lovers; training together; high-stakes testing |
| **Court** | Surveillance, performance, politics | Secret glances; public performance; private truth |
| **Military** | Duty, danger, hierarchy | Forbidden fraternization; shared danger; "we might die" |
| **Religious order** | Vows, faith, devotion | Duty vs. desire; sacred vs. profane; crisis of faith |
| **Economic binding** | Debt, contract, obligation | Power imbalance; earning freedom; shared work |
| **Arranged marriage** | Forced intimacy, expectation | Strangers to lovers; public pretense vs. private reality |

## Common Mistakes with Institutional Settings

### Mistake #1: The Toothless Institution

**What it looks like:** The institution has rules, but breaking them carries no real consequences. Characters violate policies constantly without punishment. The "forbidden" relationship is forbidden in name only.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If the institution doesn't enforce its rules, it's not really an obstacle. The tension of forbidden romance depends on the danger of being caught. If being caught means nothing, the romance loses its edge.

**How to fix it:** Show the institution's teeth. Someone else who broke the rules should suffer consequences your characters witness. The threat should feel real because it *is* real. When your characters break rules, there should be genuine fear of discovery.

### Mistake #2: The Empty Hierarchy

**What it looks like:** The institution has a ranking system, but it doesn't affect anything. Characters at different ranks interact freely. Power differences are stated but not felt.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Hierarchy creates romantic tension through imbalance. If the instructor/student or officer/enlisted dynamic doesn't actually create power differential, you've lost a source of tension. The "inappropriate" relationship is only inappropriate if the hierarchy means something.

**How to fix it:** Make rank matter. The higher-ranked character should have real power over the other — power they must navigate carefully if the relationship is to be equal. The lower-ranked character should feel the weight of the difference. Other characters should react to the inappropriateness.

### Mistake #3: The Easily Escaped Institution

**What it looks like:** Characters talk about being trapped in the institution, but they could actually leave fairly easily. The "bindings" are more inconvenient than inescapable.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If characters could walk away, their choice to stay becomes a choice — which is different from being trapped. Forced proximity requires that staying isn't really optional. If leaving is easy, you don't have a pressure cooker.

**How to fix it:** Make leaving genuinely costly. Desertion means death. Breaking contract means slavery. Expulsion means losing magic. Refusing the arranged marriage means war. The cost of leaving should be high enough that staying — even when it's hard — is clearly the only option.

### Mistake #4: The Uniform Institution

**What it looks like:** Everyone in the institution is basically the same. There are no factions, no allies, no rivals, no mentors, no threats. The institution is a monolith rather than a community.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Institutions are full of people with different agendas. A romance in an institution with no other characters lacks the dynamics that make institutional settings rich: the ally who covers for them, the rival who threatens to expose them, the mentor who might help or hinder.

**How to fix it:** Populate your institution with characters who have their own interests. Someone who wants your protagonist to succeed, someone who wants them to fail, someone who would benefit from exposing the relationship, someone who might help conceal it. The institution is a society, not a backdrop.

## Types of Institutional Settings

Institutions come in many forms. Some stories use a single institution; others combine elements. Before diving into specifics, identify what type of institution shapes your story:

**Primary institution type:**

☐ Academy/Training Ground (education, magical training, warrior school)

☐ Court/Palace (political center, noble society)

☐ Military/Wartime (army, navy, resistance, occupation)

☐ Religious Order (temple, monastery, priesthood)

☐ Economic/Labor (guild, apprenticeship, debt bondage, employment)

☐ Healing/Care (hospital, asylum, recovery)

☐ Arranged Marriage (political alliance, forced union)

☐ Hybrid (combines multiple types — specify below)

**If hybrid, what elements combine?**

Example: A military academy combines military structure with educational setting. A temple that trains warrior-priests combines religious and military. A royal court with magical rankings combines court politics with magical hierarchy.

Your hybrid: ___________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Academy/Training Ground

The academy setting is romantasy gold because it combines forced proximity, competitive rankings, and high stakes in one package. Fourth Wing, Zodiac Academy, House of Salt and Sorrows — the academy trope endures because it works.

Academies trap characters through obligation (they must complete training), time (it takes years), stakes (failure has consequences), and proximity (they live together). The combination creates intense pressure over an extended period, perfect for slow-burn romance.

The ranking system adds competition, which creates tension even between characters who might otherwise be allies. Do you help the person you're falling for succeed, knowing it might come at your expense? The academy asks characters to balance personal feelings against personal advancement.

### Why Academies Work

**What kind of academy is it?**

Magical training, military school, assassin academy, scholarly institution, religious education, craft guild school?

_______________________________________________________________

**What makes your academy dangerous or high-stakes?**

Deadly trials? Brutal competition? Magical dangers? Political intrigue? Secrets that could kill?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long do students stay?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Can students leave? What happens if they try to quit?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Ranking System

Ranking systems create tension because they make characters' relative positions visible and consequential. Rankings can create rivalry (competing for the same spot), imbalance (top-ranked and struggling interact differently), or alliance (assigned partners must cooperate despite competition).

**Does your academy have rankings? What determines rank?**

Physical prowess, magical power, test scores, combat victories, political connections, instructor favor?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do top-ranked students get? What happens to those at the bottom?**

Privileges at the top: _____________________________________________

Consequences at the bottom: _______________________________________

**How does ranking create tension between your characters?**

Competing for the same spot? One at top, one struggling? Must choose between winning and helping each other? Assigned as partners despite rivalry?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Living Arrangements

Proximity in academies comes from shared living. Dormitories, barracks, communal spaces — these force daily interaction whether characters want it or not. The less privacy available, the more intensely characters are compressed together.

**Where do students sleep? How much privacy exists?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What daily routines force interaction?**

Communal meals, training, shared bathing, curfews, inspections, study groups:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What rules govern relationships between students?**

Forbidden entirely? Forbidden between certain ranks? Allowed but discouraged? Punishable how?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Authority & Mentorship

**Who runs the academy? What power do instructors have over students?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a mentor figure who might help or hinder the relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if an instructor discovered the relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Courts & Palaces

Court settings trade physical danger for social danger. Every word is scrutinized, every glance noted. Courts are excellent for slow-burn because intimacy must be stolen in brief moments.

Courts create pressure through surveillance rather than survival. The threat isn't death (usually) — it's ruin. Reputation, position, family standing, political power — all can be destroyed by scandal. This makes every private moment precious and every public interaction a performance.

The gap between public and private is the heart of court romance. In public, they must perform whatever relationship is appropriate. In private, they can be real with each other. The contrast creates intensity — the stolen moment is more valuable because public moments are so constrained.

(Note: For the political structure of courts, see Section 5. Here we focus on court as a romantic pressure cooker.)

### Why Courts Work

**What makes your court dangerous?**

Political assassination, social ruin, blackmail, magical surveillance, loss of favor, imprisonment?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who watches everyone, and why?**

Spies, rivals, servants who report, magical surveillance, gossips:

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were seen together inappropriately?**

What defines "inappropriate" — private conversation? Touching? Being alone? Dancing too often?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Court Hierarchy

**Where does each character rank in the court hierarchy?**

(Reference Section 5 for class structures)

Protagonist's position: ____________________________________________

Love interest's position: __________________________________________

**What spaces can each access? Where would they naturally encounter each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where could they have a truly private conversation?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Court Customs

Court customs are opportunities for contact. Dances that allow touch, ceremonies that require standing close, negotiations that put people in the same room — customs can be used to create proximity that would otherwise be impossible or inappropriate.

**What rituals force interaction between people who'd otherwise avoid each other?**

(Reference Section 3 for cultural customs)

Dances, ceremonies, negotiations, festivals, religious observances, political marriages:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How could they use customs to steal intimacy while appearing to follow rules?**

The dance that allows touch, the ceremony that requires standing close, the negotiation that puts them in the same room:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Factions & Reputation

**What factions exist? Which side is each character on?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would each lose if the relationship became public?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the threat of exposure used against them?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Military & War Settings

War accelerates everything. The threat of death strips away pretense, and "we might die tomorrow" becomes catalyst for intimacy.

Military settings create pressure through danger and duty. Characters can't walk away from a war. They're bound by oath, by necessity, by the simple fact that the enemy won't let them leave. And within that binding, the constant proximity of barracks, camps, and trenches forces interaction.

The urgency of war changes romantic calculus. When tomorrow isn't guaranteed, caution seems foolish. Why wait to tell someone how you feel when you might not have another chance? This urgency can accelerate romance that might otherwise take months.

(Note: For warfare's political dimensions, see Section 5. Here we focus on military settings as romantic pressure cookers.)

### Why War Works

**What conflict is your world engaged in?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How imminent is the danger?**

Cold war (tension, espionage) or active combat (battles, sieges)?

_______________________________________________________________

**What does "we might die tomorrow" actually mean for them?**

Is death a real possibility they face? How does this urgency affect what they're willing to say or do?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Military Structure

**What's each character's role?**

Soldier, commander, medic, strategist, prisoner, spy, conscript, mercenary, support staff?

Protagonist: ____________________________________________________

Love interest: ___________________________________________________

**What rules govern relationships between ranks?**

Forbidden between officers and enlisted? Required to report relationships? Subject to reassignment?

_______________________________________________________________

**What if their relationship interfered with the mission?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Forced Proximity in War

**Where do soldiers sleep, eat, recover?**

Barracks, tents, ships, field camps — what privacy exists?

_______________________________________________________________

**What situation forces them to rely on each other for survival?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What injury might one tend for the other?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Opposite Sides

Romeo and Juliet dynamics intensify when characters are on opposite sides of a war. Love becomes treason. Trust becomes vulnerability. Every moment together risks exposure to both sides.

**If they're on opposing sides, what brought them into contact?**

Capture, neutral ground, secret negotiations, undercover work, chance meeting?

_______________________________________________________________

**What information does each have that could harm the other's side?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would each sacrifice to be together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**At what point does love become treason?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Religious Institutions

Temples, monasteries, and religious orders create unique pressure: vows that conflict with desire, sacred duties that demand sacrifice, communities where devotion is expected to eclipse personal attachment.

Religious institutions add spiritual stakes to romantic conflict. Breaking vows isn't just social transgression — it's spiritual crisis. Characters must wrestle with what their faith means to them, whether the institution represents that faith truly, and what they're willing to risk for love.

The best religious institution romances treat faith seriously. Characters don't simply abandon their beliefs for love — they struggle with real theological questions about what their faith demands and whether the institution's demands match their understanding of the divine.

(Note: For religious doctrine and beliefs, see Section 6. Here we focus on religious institutions as romantic pressure cookers.)

### The Religious Setting

**What religious institution are your characters part of or connected to?**

Temple, monastery, convent, religious order, pilgrimage site, sacred academy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What is the institution's stated purpose?**

Training priests? Preserving knowledge? Serving a deity? Healing? Protection? Isolation from the world?

_______________________________________________________________

**What vows or commitments does the institution require?**

Celibacy, obedience, poverty, silence, service, separation from family, renunciation of former identity?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Religious Conflict with Love

**Does either character have vows that conflict with the relationship?**

What vows: _____________________________________________________

What breaking them would mean (spiritually, socially, practically): _________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the relationship forbidden, or just complicated by religious duty?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would the institution do if the relationship were discovered?**

Expulsion? Punishment? Forced separation? Loss of position? Trial? Worse?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Faith & Desire

**Does either character struggle between faith and feeling?**

How do they reconcile (or fail to reconcile) devotion and desire?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a way to have both — the relationship and their faith?**

Or must they choose? (Reference Section 6 for how religion might adapt or condemn)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Economic & Labor Institutions

Guilds, apprenticeships, indentured service, and debt bondage create obligation that binds as tightly as any lock.

Economic institutions trap through obligation rather than walls. Characters might be physically able to leave, but the consequences — debt, poverty, loss of livelihood — make leaving impossible in practice. Economic bondage can be harder to see than physical imprisonment, but no less effective.

Power imbalances in economic institutions are stark. Master and apprentice, employer and worker, creditor and debtor — these relationships involve real control over someone's survival. Romance across these divides must navigate the imbalance honestly.

(Note: For economic systems generally, see Section 4. Here we focus on how economic institutions trap characters together.)

### The Economic Binding

**What economic institution binds your characters?**

Guild membership, apprenticeship, indentured service, debt bondage, employment contract, family business obligation, trade partnership?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why can't they simply leave?**

Debt that must be repaid? Contract with penalties? No other options? Would lose everything they've worked for? Legal consequences?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long are they bound?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Economic Hierarchy

**What's the power structure?**

Master and apprentice? Employer and worker? Creditor and debtor? Guild ranks? Business partners with unequal stakes?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If there's a power imbalance, how does it affect the relationship?**

Can they be equals, or does one have power over the other's livelihood? (Reference Section 4 for economic power dynamics)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen to the less powerful person if the relationship ended badly?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Forced Proximity Through Work

**What work forces them together?**

Shared workspace, shared housing, required collaboration, traveling for business, dependent on the same clients?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What risks does workplace romance create?**

Loss of position, scandal, accusations of favoritism, contract violation, guild expulsion?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Healing & Care Institutions

Hospitals, asylums, and recovery spaces create vulnerability by design. One person is weak; the other provides care. The intimacy of illness and healing is unique.

Healing institutions create pressure through vulnerability. The patient can't leave because they're too weak, too ill, or too damaged. The caregiver is bound by duty, by compassion, or by being the only one available. This mutual binding through one person's need creates intense proximity.

The power dynamic in healing relationships is stark: one person is utterly dependent on the other. This creates both intimacy (the trust required to accept care) and complication (can genuine connection form when power is so imbalanced?). The best healing romances address this honestly.

### The Care Setting

**What healing institution is involved?**

Hospital, field medical tent, asylum, magical healing center, quarantine, recovery house, private sickroom?

_______________________________________________________________

**Why is one character there?**

Injury, illness, magical affliction, mental health crisis, recovery from trauma, curse, poison?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the other character's role?**

Healer, fellow patient, visitor, guard, staff, reluctant caretaker?

_______________________________________________________________

### Vulnerability & Intimacy

**What makes the patient vulnerable?**

Physical weakness, dependence, loss of privacy, inability to leave, altered mental state, need for constant care?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimate care creates connection?**

Feeding, bathing, wound care, sitting vigil, sharing confined space, witnessing pain, providing comfort?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the power imbalance of caregiver/patient affect the relationship?**

Can genuine connection form when one is so vulnerable? Does the dynamic shift when recovery happens?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Recovery & Change

**How does the patient change during recovery?**

What does the caregiver witness? What do they learn about each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when recovery is complete?**

Does the connection survive when vulnerability ends? Does the relationship need to be rebuilt as equals?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Arranged Marriages & Political Alliances

The arranged marriage forces intimacy before trust. Strangers must navigate domesticity, physical closeness, and political pressure simultaneously.

Arranged marriages are unique because the binding is the relationship. Characters aren't trapped in a place where they might fall in love — they're trapped in a marriage that's supposed to *be* love but started as politics. The journey is from strangers sharing a bed to people who actually want to be together.

The public/private divide is particularly stark in arranged marriages. In public, they must perform as a happy couple. In private, they're strangers — or worse. The contrast between performance and reality creates tension that can develop into genuine connection as the private reality slowly comes to match the public performance.

(Note: For marriage laws and customs, see Sections 3 and 5. Here we focus on arranged marriage as a romantic pressure cooker.)

### The Arrangement

**Why is this marriage happening?**

Peace treaty, alliance, joining bloodlines, claiming territory, preventing war, magical necessity, fulfilling prophecy?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who arranged it? Do the characters have any say?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if they refuse?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Binding

**What makes the marriage unbreakable?**

Legal contract, magical binding, political treaty, religious vow, family honor?

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they live separately, or must they cohabitate?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimacy is expected?**

Public appearances, shared household, producing heirs, consummation, presenting a united front?

_______________________________________________________________

### Starting Point

**Does the story begin before or after the marriage?**

Before — the arrangement is an obstacle to escape or accept.
After — they're already bound and must learn to live together.

_______________________________________________________________

**If already married, what's their relationship like at the start?**

Strangers? Cold distance? Active hostility? Tentative curiosity? Grudging respect?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What begins to shift how they see each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Navigating Strangers-to-Lovers

**What preconceptions does each have about the other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the first thing that surprises them?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What domestic situation forces vulnerability?**

Sharing a bedroom, seeing each other sick, navigating servants who report everything, facing a crisis together?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### External Pressure

**Who wants this marriage to succeed? Who wants it to fail?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What public performance is required?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens behind closed doors when performance ends?**

_______________________________________________________________

## Institutional Ideals vs. Reality

Every institution claims to serve a purpose. The gap between what it claims and what it does creates story opportunity.

This gap is one of the most fertile sources of story in institutional settings. Characters who believe in the institution's stated purpose discovering its actual function creates disillusionment, moral crisis, and often the impetus to change or escape. Shared disillusionment can bond characters together.

**What does your institution claim to do?**

The stated mission, the noble purpose, what it tells the world:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does it actually do?**

The reality beneath the ideal — control, exploitation, preservation of power, something darker?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters believe in the institution's stated purpose?**

Are they idealists who believe in the mission? Cynics who see the truth? One of each? Do their views change?

Protagonist: _____________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Love interest: ____________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when they see behind the curtain?**

When the gap between ideal and reality becomes undeniable:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does disillusionment bring them together or create conflict?**

Do they bond over shared revelation? Or does one still believe while the other has lost faith?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Gaming the System

Every institution has people who know how to work it — and people who suffer under it.

Characters who learn to navigate their institution — finding loopholes, making allies, understanding the real rules beneath the official ones — have agency even within constraining systems. This agency can be romantic: teaching someone the tricks, using knowledge to protect someone, finding spaces within the system for connection.

**Who benefits from this institution?**

Who has power, comfort, advantage within the system?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who suffers under it?**

Who is exploited, trapped, disadvantaged by the system?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where are your characters in this hierarchy?**

Are they beneficiaries, victims, or somewhere in between? Do their positions differ?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who knows how to game the system?**

Someone who knows the loopholes, who to bribe, how to bend rules:

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters learn to work the system?**

Do they find ways around the rules? Use the institution against itself?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there corruption they could exploit — or that threatens them?**

Bribes, favoritism, blackmail, secret deals, people who can be bought:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The Diagnostic Question

For whatever institution you've chosen:

**If my characters tried to walk away right now, what would stop them?**

If the answer is "nothing" or "they'd feel bad," your institution doesn't have enough grip.

**Strong answers sound like:**
- They'd be executed for desertion
- The magical bond would kill them both
- Their families would go to war
- They'd lose their only chance at survival/power/freedom
- The enemy would capture them immediately
- They'd be stripped of their magic and exiled
- Their people would be slaughtered without the alliance
- They'd be hunted as oath-breakers

**Weak answers sound like:**
- They'd feel guilty
- It would be awkward
- Someone might be disappointed

**What is that cost in your story?**

## Final Thought: The Institution Is a Character

The best institutional settings feel alive — with their own rules, culture, corruption, and demands. The institution should press on your characters constantly, shaping what they can do, say, and feel.

Build an institution that:
- Has real rules with real consequences
- Creates meaningful hierarchy
- Includes allies, rivals, and threats
- Has a gap between stated purpose and reality
- Gives characters ways to navigate and subvert

Characters don't just exist within institutions; they're shaped by them, rebel against them, find cracks in them, and ultimately either escape them or change them.

Design an institution with enough grip that your characters can't just walk away — and then watch them try anyway. The institution creates the pressure; your characters' responses reveal who they really are.
