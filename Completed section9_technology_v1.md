# SECTION 9: Technology & Infrastructure

Technology level determines what's possible and what's difficult. Can people communicate instantly across distances, or do letters take weeks? Can they travel in hours, or does separation mean months apart? Does infrastructure exist to support privacy, or do thin walls and crowded homes make every word public? The answers shape the texture of daily life and the possibilities of romance.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — The practical reality of your world's technology. What transportation exists, how communication works, what medical care is available, how much privacy is possible. This is the technological baseline that affects everyone, whether or not they're falling in love.

**Part Two: Technology & Romance** — How technology creates or removes romantic obstacles. The pace of communication during separation, the availability of privacy, the constraints that force characters together or hold them apart. This builds on the foundation to show how technology shapes what's possible in your love story.

You need both.

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question in this section will apply to your story. If your world mirrors a familiar historical period, focus on what differs from reader expectations and what affects your plot. Skip what doesn't fit. Come back later — technological details often emerge as you write.

## How to Think About Technology in Romantasy

Technology in romantasy functions as a **possibility system** — it determines what your characters can and can't do, shaping what romance is possible. Your technology level isn't just setting — it's the rules of what romance looks like in your world.

The key insight: technology creates friction or removes it. A world with instant teleportation has no "long journey together" romance. A world with no privacy makes secrecy extremely difficult and therefore dramatic. When designing technology, ask not just "what exists?" but "what does this make easy or hard?"

### The Technology-as-Constraint Framework

**Distance constraints:** Travel times that make separation meaningful, communication delays that create uncertainty, infrastructure gaps that strand travelers.

**Privacy constraints:** Thin walls and shared spaces, servants who see and hear everything, surveillance magical or mundane, locks and private chambers.

**Consequence constraints:** Medical limits that make injury serious, contraception availability, documentation systems that make identity verifiable or forgeable.

### The "Pace of Life" Principle

Technology sets the tempo of your romance. Speed of travel, speed of communication, availability of leisure, lighting and time. A romance where letters take weeks feels entirely different from one with instant communication. Choose deliberately.

## Common Patterns: Technology in Romantasy

### How Technology Creates Romantic Tension

| Pattern | How It Works | What It Creates |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The long journey** | Travel takes time, forcing characters together in transit | Forced proximity; relationship development during travel |
| **The delayed message** | Communication lags create uncertainty and misunderstanding | Longing; dramatic irony; missed connections |
| **The servant problem** | Household staff see and hear everything; privacy is scarce | Risk of discovery; trusted confidants or dangerous witnesses |
| **The care scene** | Limited medicine means injury requires tending by companions | Physical intimacy through necessity; vulnerability |
| **The locked door** | Presence or absence of locks determines who can enter | Privacy as precious; intrusion as violation or rescue |
| **The one candle** | Darkness limits activity; light is precious or revealing | Intimate nighttime moments; the vulnerability of being seen |

### How Technology Differences Create Romantic Tension

| Difference | Conflict It Creates | Resolution Path |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Class-based access** | One character has technology the other lacks (private chambers, fast travel) | Sharing access; navigating different worlds |
| **Leisure imbalance** | One has free time; the other works constantly | Finding time together; understanding each other's constraints |
| **Privacy asymmetry** | One lives publicly; the other has private space | Whose world becomes the space for intimacy |
| **Literacy divide** | One can write letters; the other can't | Teaching; alternative communication; vulnerability |
| **Servant visibility** | One lives watched; the other lives unobserved | Learning to be together under surveillance — or escaping it |

## Common Mistakes with Technology Worldbuilding

### Mistake #1: The Convenient Technology

Technology works exactly as needed for the plot. Instant communication exists when convenient but is forgotten when separation would be dramatic. Readers track consistency. Establish your technology clearly and let it constrain you. If communication is slow, it's always slow. Constraints often generate better scenes than conveniences.

### Mistake #2: The Invisible Infrastructure

Characters move through a world where technology exists but has no texture. They travel but we never see how. Romance happens in daily life. Pick a few technological details and make them specific: maybe candles are expensive, so the scene where he lights extra candles because she's coming matters. Specificity creates texture.

### Mistake #3: The Modern Mindset

Characters in a medieval-tech world think and act like modern people. They assume privacy exists, communication is instant, travel is easy. Let your characters be native to their technology. They know the workarounds, the shortcuts, the limitations. A character who's never been alone in a room with a man doesn't find it odd; she finds the first time alone with him remarkable.

### Mistake #4: The Forgotten Servants

Wealthy characters have servants in the background, but those servants never affect anything. They're invisible when privacy is needed. In worlds with domestic servants, privacy is a luxury. Make servants real: they have loyalties, interests, and the capacity to help or harm. They're witnesses, allies, or threats.

### Mistake #5: The Costless Medicine

Medical care exists at whatever level the plot needs. Characters sustain serious injuries but recover instantly. Injury and illness create vulnerability — one of the most powerful romantic accelerants. Establish what your world's medicine can do, and let it constrain you. Let medicine be limited enough that injury matters.

# PART ONE: THE FOUNDATION

---

## Overall Technology Level

Your world's technology level sets the baseline for everything else. It determines travel speed, communication methods, daily life patterns, and what problems magic might solve that technology can't.

Understanding the technology level helps you make consistent decisions. If you're roughly medieval, you have horses but not trains, letters but not telegrams, candles but not electric lights. If you're mixing levels — magical transportation in a pre-industrial society, for instance — you need to understand what technology that magic replaces and what gaps remain.

**What's the approximate technology level?**

Reference points: Stone Age, Bronze/Iron Age, Medieval, Renaissance, Early Modern, Industrial, Modern, Futuristic, Mixed/Uneven

General tech level: ________________________________________________

**How does magic affect technology?**

## Transportation

How people move determines how long separation lasts, how difficult journeys are, and whether travel is a minor inconvenience or a major undertaking. Transportation technology shapes the pace of your story and the weight of distance.

For romance, transportation creates the "journey" space — travel time that can be used for relationship development. Slow travel means extended proximity during journeys and extended separation when apart. Fast travel compresses these, for better or worse. The dangers of travel (bandits, weather, exhaustion) create shared risk that bonds characters.

**What transportation methods exist?**

| Method | Speed | Cost | Who Has Access |
|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| On foot | | | |
| Riding animals | | | |
| Vehicles (carts, carriages) | | | |
| Ships/boats | | | |
| Flying (creatures, vehicles) | | | |
| Magical transport | | | |

The journey your characters take: ___________________________________

**What makes travel difficult or dangerous?**

Weather, terrain, bandits, creatures, cost, physical demands:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Travel Infrastructure

Roads, bridges, inns, and way stations make travel possible. Their presence or absence determines whether journeys are routine or exceptional. Good infrastructure enables commerce and communication; poor infrastructure isolates communities and makes travel an adventure.

For romance, infrastructure determines where characters can stop, rest, and be together. The roadside inn is a classic romantic setting — neutral ground, away from normal social constraints, often forcing proximity through limited rooms. Absence of infrastructure creates wilder journey conditions: camping, shelter-seeking, the intimacy of survival.

**What travel infrastructure exists?**

Roads (quality, where they go): _____________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Bridges: ________________________________________________________

Ports and harbors: ________________________________________________

Way stations, inns, caravanserais: ___________________________________

**Who maintains infrastructure?**

Government? Local lords? Guilds? No one?

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens where infrastructure doesn't exist?**

## Communication

How do people send messages across distance? The speed and reliability of communication shapes everything from military strategy to love affairs. Slow communication creates uncertainty, longing, and the weight of words carefully chosen because they'll take weeks to arrive. Fast communication makes separation more bearable but also changes what separation means.

For romance, communication speed determines the texture of separation. If letters take months, the distance aches — and misunderstandings can fester without clarification. If magical communication is instant, lovers can speak daily even when apart, but the separation becomes more about physical absence than communicative isolation. Consider what your story needs.

**What communication methods exist over distance?**

| Method | Speed | Reliability | Cost | Privacy |
|--------|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| Hand-delivered letters | | | | |
| Courier/postal system | | | | |
| Messenger birds | | | | |
| Signal systems (fire, flags) | | | | |
| Magical communication | | | | |
| Technological (telegraph, etc.) | | | | |

## Privacy & Surveillance

Privacy is precious — and in many historical and fantasy settings, it's scarce. Walls are thin, rooms are shared, servants are present. True solitude is a luxury of wealth, and even the wealthy might have attendants in every room. When privacy is rare, every moment alone becomes significant. When it's impossible, relationships develop under constant observation.

For romance, privacy determines what can happen and what can be hidden. A romance in a world of no privacy is a romance of stolen glances and carefully controlled expression. A romance with privacy available is one where characters can actually be themselves with each other. The contrast between public performance and private truth creates tension.

**How private are domestic spaces?**

Wall thickness, separate rooms, who shares space:

**Where can people have truly private conversations?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What are the consequences of being overheard?**

_______________________________________________________________

## Servants & Domestic Labor

In worlds where wealthy households include servants, those servants become part of the domestic landscape of romance. They witness everything. They handle personal items, attend intimate moments, know secrets they're paid to keep. The servant class represents both threat and resource: potential gossips who might expose a romance, or trusted allies who might enable it.

For romance, servants create a specific kind of pressure. They make privacy a negotiation, not a given. They make secrecy require active work — bribes, trusted relationships, clever timing. The lady's maid who helps her mistress prepare for a secret meeting is an accomplice. The footman who sees the lover leaving at dawn is a threat. These dynamics add complexity to what might otherwise be simple logistics.

**Do servants exist in your world? How common are they?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What do servants do?**

Cooking, cleaning, dressing, attending, managing households:

## Time & Labor

How much of daily life is consumed by survival? In pre-industrial societies, an enormous amount of time goes to basic needs: food preparation, water collection, fire maintenance, clothing care. Who does this labor shapes social structure. How much time remains after it shapes what else is possible — including romance.

For romance, labor disparity creates tension. If one character has leisure and the other works constantly, when can they be together? What does it mean for a noble to love a working person who simply doesn't have time for extended courtship? The gift of time — waiting, or freeing someone from labor so they can rest — becomes romantic. Shared work can also bond characters in ways that shared leisure cannot.

**How much time do ordinary people spend on survival tasks?**

Food preparation: _________________________________________________

Water collection: _________________________________________________

Heating/fuel: ____________________________________________________

Cleaning/maintenance: ____________________________________________

**Who does this labor?**

Servants? Women? Lower classes? Everyone? Magical solutions?

_______________________________________________________________

**How much leisure time exists, and for whom?**

Wealthy: ________________________________________________________

Middle class: ____________________________________________________

Poor/working class: _______________________________________________

**What does the disparity in free time mean for your characters?**

If one has leisure and one doesn't, how does that affect their relationship?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Medicine & Healing

What can medicine do in your world? This shapes the stakes of danger. If any wound can be healed, injuries matter less. If infection is deadly and fever kills, every injury is serious. The availability of medicine also affects who survives — childbirth, childhood illness, battlefield wounds. Death is more present in low-medicine worlds.

For romance, medical limitations create the "caretaking" dynamic. When one character is injured or ill and medicine can't instantly fix them, someone must tend them. This forced intimacy — watching through fever, changing bandages, spoon-feeding broth — creates connection. The vulnerability of being sick and the trust required to accept care accelerate intimacy in ways comfortable health cannot.

**What medical knowledge exists?**

| Condition | Treatment Available | Effectiveness |
|-----------|--------------------| --------------|
| Wounds/injuries | | |
| Infection | | |
| Common illness | | |
| Serious disease | | |
| Chronic conditions | | |
| Childbirth | | |
| Pain | | |

**Who provides medical care?**

Physicians, healers, midwives, herbalists, magical healers, family members:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What determines access to medical care?**

Cost? Location? Class? Connections?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does magical healing exist?**

How common: _____________________________________________________

How effective: ____________________________________________________

What it can't heal: ________________________________________________

Cost/limitations: __________________________________________________

**What injuries or illnesses are survivable vs. fatal?**

Easily treated: ____________________________________________________

Survivable with care: ______________________________________________

Usually fatal: _____________________________________________________

**What chronic conditions exist, and how are they managed?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Contraception & Reproduction

Contraception availability affects what intimacy means and what it risks. In worlds without reliable contraception, sex carries the possibility of pregnancy — a consequence that shapes behavior, stakes, and plot. In worlds with effective contraception, that risk is managed, changing what characters might be willing to do.

This is sensitive territory in romance, and many authors handle it obliquely or not at all. But if your story includes physical intimacy, understanding what contraception exists helps you understand what characters might fear or assume. Heir pressure — the expectation that certain characters must produce children — creates its own dynamics, especially in arranged-marriage or political-romance plots.

**What contraception exists?**

| Method | Effectiveness | Availability | Who Knows About It |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Herbal/natural | | | |
| Barrier methods | | | |
| Timing/withdrawal | | | |
| Magical prevention | | | |

**Who has access to contraception?**

Available to all? Expensive? Forbidden? Requires specific knowledge? Class-dependent?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if contraception fails or isn't used?**

Social consequences? Legal consequences? Practical consequences?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there pressure on anyone to produce heirs?**

Who faces this pressure and from whom?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do fertility issues exist?**

Infertility, difficulty conceiving, magical interference:

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Documentation & Records

In worlds with documentation, identity is verifiable. Birth certificates prove parentage. Marriage records prove unions. Identity documents allow travel. In worlds without such systems, identity is more fluid — and more dependent on personal recognition and reputation.

For romance, documentation creates both constraints and opportunities. A marriage record makes a union legal and provable — but also makes secret marriage difficult. A world without records allows for secret unions but also for false claims and uncertain legitimacy. Documents can be evidence of a relationship (love letters, marriage certificates) or evidence of deception (forged papers, false identities).

**What documentation exists?**

| Document Type | Who Keeps Records | How Reliable |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Birth records | | |
| Death records | | |
| Marriage records | | |
| Identity documents | | |
| Property records | | |
| Legal contracts | | |

**How do people prove identity?**

Personal knowledge? Documents? Witnesses? Magical verification?

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens without documentation?**

If there's no proof of birth, identity, or marriage — what are the consequences?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can documents be falsified?**

How difficult is it? What would it require? What are the risks?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Lighting

When does the day end? In worlds without electric light, darkness changes everything. Activity stops or slows. Streets become dangerous. Candles and oil lamps are expensive, making extended nighttime activity a luxury. The darkness creates intimacy and danger in equal measure.

For romance, lighting shapes what nighttime means. If light is cheap and abundant, nights are just evenings. If light is precious, darkness falls early and the world contracts to lit rooms. Firelight and candlelight create intimacy — softer, warmer, more flattering than daylight. The darkness outside the lit circle creates a world of two.

**How do people light their spaces?**

Candles, oil lamps, torches, magical light, gas, electricity:

_______________________________________________________________

**How expensive is lighting?**

Can everyone afford to stay up after dark, or is darkness the norm for the poor?

_______________________________________________________________

**What does nighttime look like?**

In cities: ________________________________________________________

In homes: _______________________________________________________

In the countryside: ________________________________________________

**What can and can't be done after dark?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Heating & Cooling

Temperature affects intimacy in obvious ways. Cold drives people together — shared warmth is survival. Heat separates — bodies that generate heat seek distance. The technology of temperature control shapes how close people live and sleep, what they wear, and when they're comfortable.

For romance, temperature creates physical necessity. The "sharing body heat" scene exists because, in cold environments without modern heating, it's genuinely practical. The sweltering heat of summer might drive characters to cool gardens, night walks, or stripped-down clothing. Temperature discomfort is vulnerability; sharing comfort is care.

**How do people stay warm?**

Fireplaces, central heating, braziers, body heat, magical warmth:

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people stay cool?**

Fans, shade, water, magical cooling, architectural solutions:

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the danger from extreme temperatures?**

Can cold or heat kill? What do people do to survive extremes?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Water & Sanitation

Water access and sanitation affect daily life profoundly. They shape where people live, how clean they are, and what health risks they face. Bathing practices particularly intersect with romance — nakedness, vulnerability, and cleanliness rituals all carry intimacy potential.

For romance, bathing scenes are classic precisely because they involve vulnerability. The availability of bathing — how often, where, how private — shapes these opportunities. In shared bathhouse cultures, bathing is social. In private-bath cultures, it's intimate. The unexpected encounter at the bath, the offering to draw someone's bath, the intimacy of washing another — all depend on how bathing works in your world.

**How do people get clean water?**

Wells, rivers, aqueducts, pumps, magical purification:

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people bathe?**

Public bathhouses, private baths, rivers/lakes, basins, rarely:

_______________________________________________________________

Frequency: ______________________________________________________

**What sanitation exists?**

Sewers, chamber pots, outhouses, magical waste disposal:

_______________________________________________________________

**What are the health implications of sanitation level?**

Disease, cleanliness, smell:

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Food & Preservation

How food is stored and preserved shapes what people eat and when. Fresh food requires access; preserved food enables independence from seasons and travel away from supply. The rituals of eating — shared meals, special foods, feast and famine — all tie to how food works.

For romance, food is sharing at the most basic level. The offering of food is care made tangible. The sharing of a meal is intimacy. Scarcity makes these gestures more meaningful — giving your food to another is giving your survival. Abundance allows for pleasure, the sensuality of good eating, the gift of rare delicacies.

**How is food preserved?**

Salting, smoking, drying, pickling, cold storage, magical preservation:

_______________________________________________________________

**How does food preservation affect daily life?**

Fresh food daily? Seasonal eating? Long-term storage possible?

_______________________________________________________________

**What food is available to different classes?**

Wealthy: ________________________________________________________

Common: ________________________________________________________

Poor: ___________________________________________________________

---

## Clothing & Textiles

What people wear and how they put it on shapes daily life and intimacy. Elaborate clothing that requires assistance to don creates dependence — and attendants who witness dressing. Simple clothing allows independence but perhaps less display. The act of undressing carries weight proportional to what's involved.

For romance, clothing is armor and vulnerability. Formal dress is performance; undress is exposure. The complexity of clothing determines whether characters can dress themselves or need help — and who provides that help. The moment of removing armor (literal or figurative) is often romantic. What's revealed when clothing comes off depends on what was concealed.

**What materials are clothes made from?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How are clothes made?**

Hand-sewn, tailored, mass-produced:

_______________________________________________________________

**How complicated is getting dressed?**

Can people dress themselves, or do they need help?

_______________________________________________________________

**What does clothing signal about class and status?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Weapons & Warfare Technology

The weapons that exist in your world shape its conflicts — and often its romances. Warrior cultures, military settings, and dangerous worlds put weapons in characters' hands. What weapons they carry, how they use them, what violence they've seen or done — these affect who they are and how they relate.

For romance, weapons represent both danger and protection. The armed character carries the capacity for violence. Whether they're a threat or a protector depends on context. Training scenes provide proximity and physical contact. The laying down of weapons signals trust. The moment someone is vulnerable — unarmed, unable to fight — creates opportunity for rescue or intimacy.

**What weapons exist?**

Melee weapons: ___________________________________________________

Ranged weapons: __________________________________________________

Siege weapons: ___________________________________________________

Magical weapons: _________________________________________________

**What armor exists?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the most advanced military technology?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Who has access to weapons?**

Restricted to military/nobility? Commonly owned? Forbidden to certain groups?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Information & Education

Who knows what — and who has access to learning more — shapes power dynamics throughout your world. Literacy, education, and information access create hierarchies. Those who control knowledge control much else. The ability to learn, read, and access information varies by class, gender, and location.

For romance, knowledge gaps create teaching dynamics — which can be intimate. The character who explains, guides, and shares knowledge occupies a position of generosity. The character who learns is vulnerable and trusting. Shared learning creates partnership. Secret knowledge creates distance until it's shared.

**What do people write on?**

Paper, parchment, clay, wax tablets, magical surfaces:

_______________________________________________________________

**What do people write with?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How are books made?**

Hand-copied, printed, magically reproduced:

_______________________________________________________________

**How expensive and rare are books?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Who can access education?**

Universal? Class-restricted? Gender-restricted?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Timekeeping

How precisely do people know what time it is? In worlds without clocks, time is approximate — sun position, meal times, church bells. Appointments are imprecise. In worlds with accurate timekeeping, coordination is possible, and lateness means something different.

For romance, timekeeping affects rendezvous. "Meet me at midnight" requires that midnight be identifiable. "Meet me when the sun touches the western tower" is more approximate. The precision or imprecision of time shapes how plans are made and how they can go wrong.

**How do people tell time?**

Sun position, bells, clocks, magical timekeepers:

_______________________________________________________________

**How precise is timekeeping?**

To the hour? The quarter-hour? The minute?

_______________________________________________________________

**Do people schedule precisely, or approximately?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Construction & Architecture

How buildings are built affects what spaces exist and what's possible within them. The size and layout of buildings determine privacy, proximity, and the geography of daily life. Construction technology determines what's impressive and what's ordinary.

For romance, architecture creates the spaces where romance happens. Private chambers, hidden gardens, tower rooms, shared halls — the built environment enables or prevents proximity. The architecture of a specific building (the palace, the manor, the inn) becomes the stage for relationship development.

**What building materials are available?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What construction techniques exist?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How tall can buildings be?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What architectural features are common?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Entertainment Technology

What do people do for enjoyment, and what tools enable that? Music, games, theater, stories — entertainment shapes social gatherings and provides occasions for interaction. The technologies of entertainment create the settings for romance.

For romance, entertainment events are classic settings. Dances require partners and physical contact. Theater provides darkness and shared emotional experience. Games create competition and play. Music stirs emotion. The occasions for entertainment are often occasions for romance.

**What entertainment exists?**

Live music, recorded music, theater, games, sports, storytelling:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What technology enables entertainment?**

Musical instruments, game equipment, performance spaces:

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Luxury vs. Necessity

What's common and what's rare shapes what gifts mean, what comfort looks like, and where class divisions fall. Understanding what's luxury in your world helps you understand what generosity looks like and what wealth can provide.

For romance, luxury is one form of care. The ability to provide comfort — warmth, softness, delicious food, beautiful things — is a form of giving. The sharing of luxury between characters of different means creates dynamics of generosity and discomfort. The absence of luxury, and the willingness to share in that absence, is its own form of intimacy.

**What technologies are luxuries only the wealthy can afford?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What technologies are available to everyone?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What technologies are completely unavailable to the poor?**

_______________________________________________________________

## Magic & Technology Integration

How do magic and technology interact in your world? Does magic replace technology, making certain inventions unnecessary? Does it enhance technology, creating hybrid solutions? Does it conflict with technology, forcing a choice between them? Or do they coexist independently?

For romance, magical technology often creates its own intimacy dynamics. Enchanted objects might connect lovers across distance. Magical heating might enable different sleeping arrangements. Magical medicine might have emotional side effects. When magic intersects with the technological aspects of daily life, it creates new romantic possibilities and constraints.

**Does magic replace certain technologies?**

What technology doesn't exist because magic fills the need:

**Does magic enhance technology?**

Enchanted items, magitech:

**Do magic and technology conflict?**

Does magic interfere with technology or vice versa?

_______________________________________________________________

**Who has access to magical vs. technological solutions?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Lost or Forbidden Technology

Some worlds include technology that once existed but is now lost, or that exists but is forbidden. These technologies create particular story possibilities — quests to recover lost knowledge, conflicts over forbidden tools, the danger of using what's banned.

For romance, forbidden technology creates secret-sharing. If one character has or knows forbidden tech, sharing that secret is trust. If both characters seek lost technology, the quest bonds them. The technology becomes symbol and goal, with the relationship developing alongside its pursuit.

**Did past civilizations have technology now lost?**

What was lost: ____________________________________________________

Why it was lost: __________________________________________________

Could it be rediscovered: ___________________________________________

**Is any technology restricted or forbidden?**

# PART TWO: TECHNOLOGY & ROMANCE

## Technology & Your Characters

Now that you've established your world's technology level, consider how it specifically affects your characters — their daily lives, their relationship possibilities, and the constraints they navigate.

Technology creates the conditions for romance. What characters can do, where they can go, how they can communicate, what privacy they have — all shaped by the technological reality of their world. Understanding their specific relationship to that technology helps you write romance that feels grounded in their lived experience.

**What technology does each character have access to?**

Protagonist: _____________________________________________________

Love interest: ____________________________________________________

**Is there a technology gap between them?**

What does one have that the other doesn't?

## Final Thought: Technology Defines What's Possible

Your technology level determines what's easy and what's impossible. If instant communication exists, separation loses weight. If healing magic fixes anything, danger has no teeth. If privacy is impossible, intimacy becomes a risk.

Technology isn't about gadgets — it's about what your world makes easy and what it makes hard. Build a technology level that creates the constraints your story needs, then let your characters navigate those constraints.
