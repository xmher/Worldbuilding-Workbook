## Sample 1

We won't re-hash what you've already learned in the character workbook. However, you should make sure your characters have motivations, fears, goals, and desires that have nothing to do with the romantic subplot. You want them to feel fleshed out.

They should think about other things than just love. The more well-rounded your characters are, the more real they will feel, and the more your readers will enjoy reading about them.

They should also have flaws and limiting beliefs that might make a romantic relationship difficult. For example, perhaps they're scared of letting people get close to them. Perhaps they're smothering and meddlesome. Perhaps they're inflexible and unwilling to compromise.

When designing your two characters, try and see how their flaws and merits will challenge each another. See where they're similar vs different.

## Sample 2

The main characters of romance novels tend to have two aspects to them.

When you create a couple that are opposites in many ways, it can lead to a dynamic filled with tension, excitement, and personal growth. Contrasting characters have the potential to learn from each other. They may help each other step out of their comfort zone or view the world from a different perspective.

The differences between the characters can lead to conflict, but this conflict can also generate intense chemistry.

Even if they seem like polar opposites, your couple will have some points of likemindedness that allow them to bond, even if it takes a while to discover these similarities.

Even characters who are opposites will have some similarities, and very likeminded characters will still have differences and points of conflict.

## Sample 3

Setting helps establish the emotional tone of the story. It can convey warmth, excitement, nostalgia, or any other desired emotional atmosphere, which in turn, influences the reader's emotional response to the characters and their relationships.

A well-described setting immerses readers in the story, making them feel like they are right there with the characters. This level of engagement can heighten emotional involvement and investment in the romance.

Settings often carry symbolic meaning in romance novels. For instance, a palace may represent fairy-tale romance, while a cabin in the woods can reinforce themes of intimacy and self-discovery. The setting can emphasise the themes and messages the author wants to convey.

Let’s develop your story’s setting.

## Sample 4

To immerse your reader, engage their senses when you describe the setting of your romance novel. The following examples will give you some ideas of how to describe some popular settings in romance novels.

Sights, smells, sounds, touch, and taste all contribute to the reader’s experience of a place. By layering these sensory details, you can make a setting feel vivid and emotionally resonant rather than flat or generic.

You don’t need to describe everything at once. Often, focusing on just one or two sensory details can be enough to ground the reader in the scene and reinforce the emotional tone you’re trying to convey.

---

## Sample 5

Side characters are often an important part of romantic novels. They can introduce conflict or obstacles to the budding romance. This can be in the form of a disapproving friend, a meddling family member, or a rival for one of the main characters' affections.

Side characters may have their own subplots that intersect with the main plot. These subplots can provide opportunities for character growth, add layers to the story, and ultimately influence the development of the main romance.

Well-developed side characters can be endearing to readers. They create a sense of familiarity and connection, making readers invested in their stories and relationships, not just those of the main characters.

---

## Sample 6

Antagonists in romance novels are characters who serve as an obstacle or source of conflict in a romantic relationship.

Unlike the traditional antagonist in a story who may be a villain or adversary, a romance story’s antagonist doesn't often have malicious intent but plays a role in creating tension or challenges within the romantic plot.

Antagonists are not necessarily villains. They are often complex characters with their own motivations and emotions. Their role in the story is to challenge the main characters' relationship and provide opportunities for character development, growth, and exploration of the themes of love and commitment.

---

## Sample 7

Tropes in romantic novels are recurring themes, plot devices, character types, or narrative elements that are commonly used in fiction.

Tropes often provide a sense of familiarity to readers. People may seek out specific tropes because they enjoy the comfort of knowing what to expect. This can help with marketing your novel, as readers may favour certain tropes.

However, overuse or poor execution of tropes can lead to cliché or formulaic storytelling, which can turn readers away. When tropes are used without creativity or depth, they can make a story feel predictable or uninspired.

---

## Sample 8

Before you can use a trope effectively, it's essential to understand it thoroughly. Study examples of the trope in other works to see how it has been used, what makes it work, and how it can be subverted or modified.

Tropes can serve as a solid foundation for your story, providing a familiar structure that readers can connect with. However, your characters are the heart of your story. Invest time in developing well-rounded, believable characters, regardless of tropes.

One effective way to use tropes is to subvert reader expectations. Introduce twists or variations that challenge the typical outcomes associated with the trope.

## Sample 9

This workbook teaches you how to outline a story that fits the 3 act structure. This structure provides a general framework for a story, but it can be customised and expanded to fit the needs of specific writers and stories.

Outlining the plot is an important step in the writing process, as it helps writers organise their ideas and see how all the pieces of the story fit together.

However, there's nothing wrong with straying from this outline. Your outline is a guide that will hold your hand through the writing process, not a prison.

---

## Sample 10

Your structure simply provides a blueprint. It gives your story a shape, but it allows room for creativity and uniqueness.

The three act structure is a useful tool for beginners who are learning how to craft a compelling narrative. It provides a clear framework to understand and organise the components necessary for a successful story.

It’s not just for beginners. It’s a widely used and well-established narrative structure that's effective for writers of all levels of experience, including experts.

---

## Sample 11

Every choice your character makes is influenced by something that has happened prior. Just like a real person, your character has fears, goals, motivations, and needs.

For example, a character who grew up in a poor, dangerous environment might have very different priorities than someone who grew up safe and comfortable.

Understanding these internal drivers will help you write characters whose decisions feel believable and emotionally grounded.

---

## Sample 12

Motivation and goal are not the same thing. Motivations are internal. Goals are external and actionable.

You need a goal to propel the story forward, and this goal is driven by an internal motivation.

This motivation is often different to what would actually make your character happy, which creates internal conflict and room for growth over the course of the story.

---

## Sample 13

What a character wants and what they need are often not the same thing. This difference is what allows them to learn and grow.

At the start of the story, your character may be chasing something they believe will fix their problems. Over time, they may realise that what they truly need is something else entirely.

This shift is often at the heart of a compelling character arc.

---

## Sample 14

Your character now has a motivation, but what made them this way.

Perhaps they crave riches because they were once poor. Perhaps they crave the love of a prince because they saw their mother lose everything by marrying a peasant.

Their backstory should explain their motivation, but it can also explain some of their traits and behaviours in the present.

---

## Sample 15

If they are defensive and angry, perhaps someone hurt them in the past.

If they are vain, perhaps they're used to people only valuing them for their looks.

These experiences don’t need to be spelled out in detail in your novel, but understanding them can help you write more consistent and emotionally coherent characters.

---

## Sample 16

If it is relevant to your story, consider how the relationships in a character's past have shaped who they are today.

Getting left at the altar might lead a character to be closed-off in love. Being neglected by their parents might make a character fear abandonment or become hyper-independent.

Knowing this history can inform how your character behaves in relationships throughout the story.

---

## Sample 17

Although you may not choose to reveal the relationships from your character's past in your novel, you might benefit from knowing about them.

This is because it may inform your characters' views and choices throughout the story, even if it never appears explicitly on the page.

It’s up to you how deeply you explore this.

---

## Sample 18

We learn a lot about a character from the way they interact with others.

A character who treats their boss with deference but speaks harshly to their subordinates will be perceived very differently from someone who behaves consistently across relationships.

These interactions can reveal values, insecurities, and power dynamics without direct exposition.

---

## Sample 19

Relationships can be a great source of conflict. It doesn't just have to be romantic.

A friendship betrayal, a disappointed parent, or a back-stabbing colleague can all introduce tension and emotional stakes that feed into the larger story.

These dynamics often intersect with the main plot in meaningful ways.

---

## Sample 20

Remember that key relationships should serve a purpose in the overall narrative.

They should contribute to character development, reinforce themes, or create meaningful obstacles for the protagonist.

You don’t need to include every relationship your character has ever had. Focus on the ones that matter most to the story you’re telling.
