# SECTION 8: Magic System

Magic is often what makes a fantasy world feel like *fantasy*. But magic that can do anything is magic that means nothing. The most memorable magic systems have rules, costs, and limits — and those constraints are what make them interesting. When your character reaches for their power, we need to know what they're risking, what they're capable of, and what's completely beyond them.

This section is divided into two parts:

**Part One: The Foundation** — How magic works in your world. Where it comes from, who can use it, what it costs, and what it cannot do. This is the mechanical reality of your system, the rules that exist regardless of your characters' romantic situation.

**Part Two: Magic & Romance** — How magic creates romantic tension. Power imbalances, magical bonds, intimacy through shared power, the vulnerability of revealing your abilities, and the ways magic can both connect and divide.

You need both. A romance where one character has devastating power needs a believable magic system that makes that power feel real and costly. A world with rich magical lore needs to show how that magic actually pressures, threatens, or enables your love story.

---

## A Note Before You Begin

Not every question in this section will apply to your story.

**Magic can stay mysterious.** Some stories work better with soft, atmospheric magic that isn't fully explained. You don't need to know the physics of every spell — sometimes "it's magic" is enough.

**Focus on what creates stakes.** Don't detail every magical ability unless those abilities matter for your plot. The question isn't "what can magic do?" but "what can magic do that affects my characters right now?"

**Skip what doesn't apply.** If your characters aren't magic users, skip the sections about using power. If there are no magical bonds in your world, skip those questions.

---

## How to Think About Magic in Romantasy

Magic in romantasy isn't just about battles and plot problems. It's also about *intimacy* — how your characters connect, what they hide from each other, what it means when they finally let someone see their power (or their vulnerability).

### The Magic-as-Intimacy Framework

Consider how magic creates opportunities for closeness or distance:

**Vulnerability through magic:**
- Using magic when exhausted or emotional
- Revealing powers you usually hide
- Allowing someone to see you at full, terrifying strength
- Letting someone heal you, touch your mind, or enter your magical space

**Connection through magic:**
- Shared abilities or training
- Magical communication when apart
- Complementary powers that work better together
- Bonds, marks, or links that tie characters together

**Division through magic:**
- Power imbalances that create tension
- Abilities that make trust difficult (mind-reading, illusion, compulsion)
- Being on opposite sides of a magical conflict
- One character's magic threatening what the other loves

### The Limitation Principle

What magic *cannot* do matters more than what it can. Unlimited power is boring; power with constraints creates drama.

Every effective magic system has:
- **Costs** that make using magic a decision, not an automatic solution
- **Limits** that force characters to be creative, strategic, or desperate
- **Failures** that show magic can't solve everything

Ask yourself: *If my protagonist could solve their biggest problem with magic, would they?* If yes, your magic system might need harder limits.

## Common Patterns: Magic in Romantasy

### Power Dynamics That Create Romance Tension

| Pattern | How It Works | What It Creates |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The power gap** | One character is vastly more powerful than the other | Questions of equality, protection vs. partnership |
| **Opposite powers** | Their magic conflicts or cancels each other out | "We shouldn't be able to be together" tension |
| **Complementary powers** | Together they're stronger than apart | Forced partnership, discovering they need each other |
| **Hidden power** | One conceals their abilities from the other | Secrets, eventual revelation, trust issues |
| **Forbidden magic** | One uses magic the other's people hate or fear | "Love the person, hate what they are" conflict |
| **Bonded magic** | Their powers are literally linked | Forced proximity, intimacy whether they want it or not |

### The Magical Bond Trope

Many romantasies feature magical connections between characters — soul bonds, mating marks, magical contracts, shared powers. These create specific tensions:

| How It's Used | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **Bond as trap** | Characters bound against their will must navigate unwanted intimacy |
| **Bond as proof** | The magic confirms what they feel, removing doubt but adding pressure |
| **Bond as secret** | One knows about the bond; the other doesn't |
| **Bond as danger** | The connection makes them vulnerable to each other or to enemies |
| **Bond as choice** | They must actively complete or accept the bond |

## Common Mistakes with Magic Worldbuilding

### Mistake #1: The Deus Ex Magica

**What it looks like:** Magic solves plot problems conveniently whenever the story needs it. New abilities appear without setup. Limits are forgotten when inconvenient.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If magic can solve anything, stakes evaporate. If the reader doesn't know what magic can and can't do, they can't feel tension when characters are in danger.

**How to fix it:** Establish your magic's capabilities and limits early. If a magical solution exists, either use it and deal with the consequences, or explain clearly why it won't work. Foreshadow any significant magical abilities before they become critical.

### Mistake #2: The Powerless Love Interest

**What it looks like:** One character is incredibly powerful; the other has nothing to contribute. The powerful one does all the saving, fighting, and problem-solving while the love interest watches.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Romance requires some form of equality or balance. If one character is always the rescuer and the other is always the rescued, it stops feeling like partnership.

**How to fix it:** Give the less powerful character something the powerful one needs — knowledge, connections, emotional insight, a skill magic can't replicate. Or let them contribute in non-magical ways that are equally valued. Power isn't just magic.

### Mistake #3: The Inconsistent Cost

**What it looks like:** Magic is established as exhausting or painful, but characters use it constantly without seeming to suffer. Costs are mentioned once and then forgotten.

**Why it hurts your romance:** If using magic for someone is supposed to be a sacrifice, the cost needs to be real and visible. A dramatic scene where the love interest heals the protagonist loses impact if they're fine five minutes later.

**How to fix it:** Track cumulative cost. Show the toll on the body, the mind, the soul. Let characters refuse to use magic because the cost is too high. Make the moment when they use it anyway meaningful.

### Mistake #4: Magic Without Personal Stakes

**What it looks like:** The magic system is well-developed mechanically but never connects to character or relationship. Powers are just tools, not expressions of identity or sources of conflict.

**Why it hurts your romance:** In romantasy, magic should be personal. It should reveal character, create vulnerability, and affect relationships. A magic system that's only about plot logistics is missing the genre's emotional core.

**How to fix it:** For each character's magic, ask: What does this power mean to them? What does using it reveal about who they are? How might it affect their relationship? What would it mean to share this power — or to have it used against them?

### Mistake #5: The Informed Power Gap

**What it looks like:** We're told one character is incredibly powerful, but we never see it. Or we're told there's a power imbalance, but both characters seem equally capable in practice.

**Why it hurts your romance:** Power dynamics only create tension if readers feel them. If the "weak" character is actually quite competent, the supposed inequality rings false.

**How to fix it:** Show the power gap in action. Let the powerful character do something that makes clear how outclassed the other is. Or let the less powerful character struggle with something the other could handle easily. Make the gap visible and felt.

# PART ONE: THE FOUNDATION

## Types of Magic Systems

Magic doesn't have to mean spellcasting. Different approaches create different story possibilities.

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Elemental** | Control over natural forces (fire, water, earth, air, etc.) | Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Priory of the Orange Tree |
| **Spellcasting/Incantation** | Words, gestures, or rituals produce specific effects | Harry Potter, The Name of the Wind |
| **Innate/Inborn Abilities** | Powers you're born with, often tied to bloodline or species | X-Men, Graceling, Ninth House |
| **Blood/Sacrifice Magic** | Power drawn from blood, pain, or giving something up | Blood and Ash series, Daughter of No Worlds |
| **Emotional/Will-Based** | Magic fueled by feelings, desire, or force of will | The Rage of Dragons |
| **Bond-Based** | Magic tied to a connection with another being (familiar, dragon, mate) | Fourth Wing, His Dark Materials |
| **Artifact/Object-Based** | Power resides in objects, not people | Lord of the Rings, Howl's Moving Castle |
| **Transformation/Shifter** | Ability to change form — into animals, elements, other people | ACOTAR (shifting), Skin of the Sea |
| **Death/Necromancy** | Power over death, spirits, or the boundary between life and death | Gideon the Ninth, Sabriel |
| **Bargain/Contract Magic** | Power gained through deals, oaths, or binding agreements | ACOTAR (bargains), Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell |
| **Symbiotic/Parasitic** | Magic requires or is enhanced by another being | The Fifth Season |
| **Music/Art-Based** | Creation through song, art, or creative expression | Wintersong, The Singing Hills Cycle |
| **Knowledge/True Names** | Power comes from knowing the true nature of things | Earthsea, The Name of the Wind |
| **Psychic/Mental** | Mind-reading, telekinesis, projection, mental influence | Shatter Me series |

**Which type(s) best describe your magic system?**

You can combine multiple approaches:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If your system doesn't fit these categories, describe what makes it different:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Source

Every magic system has an origin — where the power actually comes from. This shapes everything: who has access, how it's viewed by society, and what it costs to use.

**Where does magic come from in your world?**

Consider: the gods or divine forces, the natural world (ley lines, elemental forces, the land itself), an internal source (bloodlines, souls, emotions), external objects (artifacts, crystals, runes), knowledge and study (spells, rituals, ancient texts), a bargain or bond (with spirits, demons, the fae, dragons), something unknown or mysterious.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a single source of magic, or multiple types with different origins?**

If multiple, how do they interact — or conflict?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can the source be depleted, corrupted, or cut off?**

What happens if it is?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do people in your world *explain* where magic comes from?**

Is the truth different from what most believe?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Who Can Use Magic

Not everyone has to be magical — and who *can* wield magic shapes everything from social structure to your protagonist's place in the world.

**How common is magic in your world?**

| Prevalence | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Universal | Nearly everyone has some magical ability |
| Common | A significant minority (10-30%) has magic |
| Uncommon | Magic is rare but not remarkable (1-10%) |
| Rare | Magic is exceptional — one in a thousand or less |
| Unique | Only specific individuals, bloodlines, or chosen ones |

Which describes your world?

_______________________________________________________________

**What determines whether someone can use magic?**

| Determinant | How It Works in Your World |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Birth/bloodline | |
| Species/race | |
| Training/study | |
| Triggering event (trauma, ritual, near-death) | |
| Possession of object or bond with creature | |
| Random chance | |
| Sacrifice or bargain | |
| Divine selection | |

**Can magical ability be gained if you weren't born with it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can it be lost or taken away?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If magic is inherited, how does that affect families, dynasties, and marriages?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If it's learned, who controls access to that knowledge — and who's excluded?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## How Magic Works

This is the mechanical heart of your system — the "physics" of magic. You don't need to explain everything to readers, but *you* should understand how it operates so your story stays consistent.

**How does someone actually *do* magic? What does the process look like?**

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Verbal component (words, songs, incantations) | |
| Physical component (gestures, movement, dance) | |
| Mental component (concentration, visualization, emotional state) | |
| Material component (objects, ingredients, symbols) | |
| Other requirements | |

**What does magic look like when it happens?**

What do bystanders see, hear, or feel?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long does it take to use magic?**

Can it be done instantly, or does it require preparation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can magic be interrupted?**

What happens if it's disrupted mid-use?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is magic precise or unpredictable?**

Does the same action always produce the same result, or is there variation based on skill, emotion, or circumstance?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Cost

This is where your magic system gets genuinely interesting. Unlimited power is boring; power with a price creates drama.

**What does using magic cost?**

| Cost Type | How It Manifests in Your World |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Physical (exhaustion, pain, injury) | |
| Temporal (lifespan, aging) | |
| Emotional (memories fade, feelings dull, sanity frays) | |
| Material (rare components consumed) | |
| Moral/spiritual (corruption, debt, loss of humanity) | |
| Environmental (draws from surroundings) | |
| Relational (costs something from bonds or connections) | |

**Does the cost scale with the power used?**

Is a small spell a small price, while world-shaking magic demands everything?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when someone overextends — uses more magic than they can safely handle?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the cost immediate, or does it accumulate over time?**

Can someone use magic freely for years and then pay all at once?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your protagonist know the full cost of their power, or are they going to find out the hard way?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Situational Costs and Constraints

Beyond personal cost, there are times when magic *can't* be used safely even if the user has the power.

**Can magic be tracked, sensed, or traced?**

Does using power reveal your location or identity?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there times when using magic would cause strategic problems?**

Alerting enemies, breaking cover, violating treaties, leaving evidence?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there political or social consequences for using certain powers?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Limits

What magic *cannot* do is more important than what it can. Limits create stakes, force creativity, and prevent your characters from solving every problem with a wave of their hand.

**What is absolutely impossible with magic in your world?**

Name at least three things magic cannot do:

1. ___________________________________________________________________________

2. ___________________________________________________________________________

3. ___________________________________________________________________________

### Types of Magic Limitations

| Limitation Type | Examples | Your World |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **Impossible Acts** | Can't raise the truly dead, can't create genuine love, can't time travel | |
| **Material Weaknesses** | Iron disrupts fae magic, silver harms werewolves, salt breaks enchantments | |
| **Environmental Limits** | Magic fails in certain locations, weakens at certain times, doesn't work underwater | |
| **Physical State** | Can't use when exhausted, injured, emotionally compromised | |
| **Knowledge/Skill Caps** | Must learn specific abilities, years of training required | |
| **Resource Depletion** | Energy runs out, limited uses per day, power waxes and wanes | |
| **Backlash/Consequences** | Overuse causes damage, failed magic backfires, dark magic corrupts | |
| **Range and Scale** | Only affects what you can see/touch, power diminishes with distance | |
| **Countermeasures** | Other magic users can block or dispel, certain creatures are immune | |
| **Social/Legal Limits** | Magic is illegal, regulated, taboo; certain powers mark you as criminal | |
| **Specificity** | Fire mages can't do ice magic, each person has only one gift | |
| **Consent/Will** | Can't affect someone who truly resists, can't read unwilling minds | |

**Which limitation types exist in your system? Check all that apply and note specifics:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there things magic *can* technically do, but no one attempts because the cost or risk is too high?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can magic be resisted or defended against?**

How do non-magical people protect themselves?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Scale and Power

Not all magic users are equal. Understanding the range of power helps you place your characters and set stakes appropriately.

**What's the range of magical power in your world?**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Weakest magic user | |
| Average magic user | |
| Strongest magic user | |

**Where do your protagonist and love interest fall on this scale?**

| Character | Power Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Protagonist | | |
| Love Interest | | |

**Is there a significant gap between them?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is raw power the only measure of magical strength?**

Can skill, creativity, knowledge, or cleverness make a "weaker" magic user formidable?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the most impressive feat of magic in your world's history or legend?**

Could anyone alive today replicate it?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is magical power fixed, or can it grow?**

How does someone become more powerful — and what do they risk in pursuing that growth?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Types and Specializations

**Is magic in your world one unified force, or are there distinct types, schools, or disciplines?**

If distinct types exist, list them:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do magic users specialize, or can someone master multiple types?**

What determines their specialty — birth, choice, training, or something else?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are some types of magic considered more valuable, dangerous, or taboo than others?**

| Type | How It's Viewed |
|------|-----------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**Do different types of magic interact?**

Can they combine for greater effect, cancel each other out, or create unexpected reactions?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Hard Magic vs. Soft Magic

Magic systems exist on a spectrum between "hard" and "soft."

**Hard Magic** has clearly defined rules, costs, and limitations. Readers understand what magic can and can't do, so magical solutions feel earned.

*Examples: Mistborn, Fullmetal Alchemist, The Name of the Wind*

**Soft Magic** is mysterious, atmospheric, and not fully explained. It creates wonder and danger because we *don't* know its limits. The risk: if you solve major problems with undefined magic, it feels like cheating.

*Examples: Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Uprooted*

**Most romantasy falls somewhere in between** — defined enough that readers understand stakes, mysterious enough to feel magical.

| HARD | ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ | SOFT |
|------|----------------------------------|------|
| Clear rules, readers understand how it works | | Mysterious, wonder and danger |

**Where does your magic fall?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If your magic is on the harder side:**

Have you established the rules clearly enough that readers will accept magical solutions?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If your magic is on the softer side:**

Are you avoiding using vague magic to solve major plot problems?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If you're in the middle:**

Which elements are rule-bound and which are mysterious?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magic and Society

**How has magic shaped the power structures in your world?**

Who's on top because of magic — and who's at the bottom?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do non-magical people think of magic users?**

Fear? Reverence? Resentment? Envy? Exploitation?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there laws governing magic use?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What's legal | |
| What's illegal | |
| What's regulated | |
| Who enforces magical law | |

**Are there organizations, guilds, or institutions built around magic?**

| Institution | Purpose | Who Belongs |

# PART TWO: MAGIC & ROMANCE

---

## The Source and Your Romance

The origin of magic can connect your leads — or divide them.

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre is human; Tamlin is High Fae. That's the obvious gap — she's mortal and powerless in his world. But there's also something he's not telling her about why she's really there. The reader and protagonist experience the divide as a mystery: *why won't he tell me the truth?*

**How might the source of magic affect your leads' relationship?**

Consider: Do they draw from the same source or different ones? Is one's source forbidden or feared by the other's people? Does access to the source create hierarchy between them?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magical Status and Power Dynamics

*In Serpent & Dove:* Lou is a witch hiding her magic; Reid is a witch hunter sworn to kill her kind. It's not just that one has magic and one doesn't — it's that his entire identity is built on destroying what she is.

**What is each character's magical status?**

| Character | Magical Status | What This Means Socially |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Protagonist | | |
| Love Interest | | |

**Does this create a power imbalance? How?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If one is more powerful, what does the less powerful one bring that the powerful one needs?**

(Knowledge, perspective, emotional grounding, skills magic can't replicate?)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magic as Vulnerability

Using magic often requires vulnerability — concentration that leaves you defenseless, exhaustion after casting, revealing abilities you usually hide.

*In Fourth Wing:* Dragon riders share a mental bond. Violet and Xaden can speak mind-to-mind, which means he knows when she's scared, when she's lying, when she's thinking about him. There's nowhere to hide. The bond strips away the walls they've both built.

**Is there anything about how magic is performed that creates vulnerability or intimacy?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean for your protagonist to use their magic *in front of* their love interest in a way they don't show others?**

Revealing their full power, their vulnerability, or a secret aspect of their abilities?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean for them to use magic *for* their love interest — not in battle, but in a personal, private way?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Cost of Magic in Romance

*In From Blood and Ash:* Poppy's gift lets her sense others' emotions and take away their pain — but it means absorbing that pain into herself. Every time she helps someone, she suffers for it. When she uses her power on Hawke, she's choosing to hurt for him.

**How might the cost of magic create romantic tension or sacrifice?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment when one character pays a significant magical cost for the other?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What they do | |
| What it costs | |
| Does the other know? | |

---

## Magical Limitations and Romance

*In The Cruel Prince:* The Fae cannot lie. Every cruel thing Cardan says, Jude knows he means. And every rare moment of honesty hits harder because she knows it's true — he literally cannot say "I love you" unless he does.

**Do any of your magic's limitations affect the relationship directly?**

Consider: Magic that doesn't work on people you love. Magic that fails when emotions are strong. Limits that make trust difficult or that prove truth.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a limitation that creates a specific romantic complication?**

| Limitation | How It Affects the Romance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| | |

---

## Complementary and Conflicting Magic

*In Gideon the Ninth:* Harrow is a necromancer; Gideon is her cavalier, a swordswoman with no magic. They're supposed to function as a unit — the magic demands partnership. But Harrow and Gideon hate each other. The magic demands partnership; their history demands distance.

**How do your leads' types of magic interact?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Protagonist's magic | |
| Love Interest's magic | |
| How they might clash | |
| How they might complement each other | |

**Is there something they can do together that neither can do alone?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magical Bonds

If your world includes magical connections between people — soul bonds, mating marks, magical contracts, shared power — they have significant romantic implications.

**Does your magic system include any bonds, bargains, or connections between people?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| What the bond is called | |
| How it forms | |
| What it does | |
| Can it be broken? | |

**If you have magical bonds, are they chosen or fated?**

What does your story say about destiny vs. choice?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your protagonists have or develop such a bond?**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| When it forms | |
| Whether they want it | |
| What complications it creates | |

---

## Magic as Connection and Obstacle

**How does magic create obstacles between your leads?**

Consider: forbidden types of magic, power imbalances, magic that makes trust difficult (mind reading, illusion, shapeshifting), duties that pull them apart.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How might magic create connection between your leads?**

Consider: shared abilities, one can help/heal/protect the other, magical communication when apart, moments where using magic together creates intimacy.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Magic Through the Story

### Act 1: The Inciting Incident

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre kills a faerie — a magical creature — in the woods. Magic brings the consequences: Tamlin arrives to claim her life or take her to his realm.

**What magical event pulls your protagonist into the story?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does this magical event connect them to the love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Act 2: Rising Action

*As Feyre spends time in the Spring Court, she's surrounded by magic she doesn't understand and can't use. Meanwhile, a curse she doesn't know about is ticking down, adding urgency.*

**What magical obstacles or revelations arise as your leads grow closer?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does magic create intimacy or distance during this phase?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Act 3: Crisis

*The curse breaks — sort of. Feyre is powerless among the most powerful beings. The magic that drew them together now seems to make saving each other impossible.*

**What magical crisis makes everything seem hopeless?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Act 4: Resolution

*Feyre solves a magical test, and the answer is "love." Her sacrifice breaks the curse and transforms her.*

**How does your protagonist's romantic choice enable the magical resolution?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What is your protagonist's magical state at the end versus the beginning?**

Have they gained power, lost it, transformed, or learned to use it differently?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Integration Check

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| How does magic affect your government/power structure (Section 5)? | |
| How does magic interact with your religion (Section 6)? | |
| How did magic shape your world's history (Section 7)? | |
| How does magic affect your economy (Section 4)? | |
| How does geography interact with magic (Section 1)? | |

---

## Consistency Check

**Write out your magic system in two or three sentences — source, who can use it, how it works, main cost, biggest limit:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does your magic system contradict itself anywhere?**

(For example: "Magic is extremely rare" but also "Every noble family has a court mage.")

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Think of the biggest problem your protagonist faces. If a skeptical reader asked "Why didn't they just use magic to fix that?" — what's your answer?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's one thing you're still unsure about in your magic system?**

(Write it down — you may figure it out as you draft.)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Quick Reference: Magic Stakes

| Element | Your World |
|---------|------------|
| Type(s) of magic | |
| Source of magic | |
| Who can use it | |
| Primary cost | |
| Most important limitation | |
| Protagonist's magical status | |
| Love Interest's magical status | |

## Final Thought: Magic Makes the Impossible Possible — Except When It Doesn't

The best magic systems in romantasy do two things:

They make the impossible possible — creating wonder, enabling the extraordinary, letting characters do things that take our breath away.

And they make some things impossible — creating stakes, forcing sacrifice, ensuring that love must be chosen rather than conjured.

Your magic should be powerful enough to matter and limited enough to create tension. It should be a source of both strength and vulnerability for your characters. It should bring them together in ways that wouldn't be possible otherwise — and threaten to tear them apart in ways that are uniquely magical.

Build a magic system that makes your romance feel inevitable and impossible at the same time.
