# APPENDIX: WORLDBUILDING QUICKSTART

## For Writers Who Want to Build Before They Plot

Some writers need to know their world before they can find their story. If you're one of them, this appendix gives you the essential worldbuilding decisions that directly feed into premise development.

This isn't meant to replace the full Romantasy Worldbuilding Workbook — it's a fast-track version focused on the elements that generate conflict, stakes, and romantic obstacles. Once you've worked through your premise, you can always return to the complete workbook to deepen what you've established here.

**The goal:** Build just enough world to know what's keeping your characters apart and what's forcing them together.

---

## 1. WHERE DOES THIS STORY HAPPEN?

Before you can write conflict, you need to know what kind of container your story lives in.

**What's the scope of your world?**

| Scale | What It Looks Like | Best For |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Single location** | An academy, palace, ship, isolated estate, besieged castle | Tight focus, forced proximity, limited cast |
| **Single region** | One kingdom, territory, or city-state | Political intrigue, local stakes, concentrated power |
| **Multiple nations** | Several kingdoms or territories in conflict or alliance | Enemies-to-lovers across battle lines, diplomatic marriages |
| **Epic scope** | Continents, worlds, or realms | World-ending stakes, journeys, culture clashes |

**Check the scale that fits your story:** _______________________________________________

**Name your primary location(s):** _______________________________________________

**What makes this place a pressure cooker?**

The best romantasy settings trap characters together. What makes escape difficult, costly, or impossible in your world?

## 2. WHAT FORCES THEM TOGETHER?

Romantasy runs on proximity — characters who could simply walk away from each other rarely generate enough tension to sustain a novel. What physical, social, or magical circumstances force your leads into each other's orbit?

**Common proximity drivers:**

- **Institutional:** They're both at the same academy, court, military unit, or organization
- **Geographic:** They're trapped by weather, terrain, siege, or journey
- **Political:** Diplomatic mission, arranged marriage, peace negotiation, hostage situation
- **Professional:** They must work together toward a shared goal
- **Magical:** A bond, curse, or prophecy ties them together
- **Circumstantial:** They're the only survivors, only ones who know the truth, or only ones who can complete the task

**What forces your characters into proximity?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Could they leave if they wanted to? If yes, what would it cost them?**

## 3. WHAT KEEPS THEM APART?

Equally important: what obstacles prevent them from simply getting together? The world should make their union difficult, forbidden, or seemingly impossible.

**Common barriers:**

| Barrier Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Political** | They're from enemy nations, opposing factions, or rival houses |
| **Social/Class** | Servant and noble, commoner and royal, different castes |
| **Species** | Human and Fae, mortal and immortal, different magical races |
| **Legal** | Their union is literally against the law |
| **Religious** | Their faiths forbid the relationship, or one is considered unholy |
| **Magical** | A curse, prophecy, or magical rule prevents their union |
| **Professional** | Duty forbids the relationship (commander/soldier, priest/anyone) |
| **Historical** | Their families or peoples have blood between them |

**What worldbuilding-based obstacle keeps your leads apart?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How serious is this obstacle? Is it inconvenient, socially damaging, or life-threatening?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

## 4. WHO HAS POWER?

Understanding your world's power structure tells you what your characters are up against — and what they might gain or lose through their choices.

**Answer quickly:**

**What type of government exists?** (Monarchy, empire, theocracy, council, feudal system, tribal, something else?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Who currently rules?** (Even a vague answer helps — "a young queen," "a council of mages," "no one; it's chaos")

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What does the ruling power want?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How does the ruling power view your protagonists' relationship?** (Approving, disapproving, indifferent, threatened by it?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What could the power structure do to your characters if it wanted to stop them?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

## 5. WHAT'S FORBIDDEN?

Every romantasy world has rules — spoken and unspoken — about who can be with whom. These rules create stakes.

**What relationships are forbidden or taboo in your world?**

Check any that apply to your story, and note the consequence for breaking the rule:

| Forbidden Union | Applies? | Consequence |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Cross-class relationships | | |
| Inter-species relationships | | |
| Relationships across enemy lines | | |
| Same-sex relationships | | |
| Relationships outside approved matches | | |
| Relationships that threaten inheritance/succession | | |
| Relationships with certain magical types | | |
| Relationships forbidden by religious law | | |

**Does your romance violate any of these?** Which one(s)?

_______________________________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were caught?**

## 6. DOES MAGIC EXIST? (If Yes, Answer These)

If your world has magic, you need to know enough about it to understand how it affects the romance. Skip this section if your story doesn't include magic.

**The Five Questions:**

**1. Who has magic?**
(Everyone? A special few? One specific group or bloodline? One of your leads and not the other?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**2. What can magic do — and what can't it do?**
(Be specific about limits. Unlimited magic is boring magic.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**3. What does magic cost?**
(Energy, pain, years of life, sanity, something else? Free magic has no stakes.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**4. How does society view magic users?**
(Revered, feared, controlled, hunted, ordinary?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**5. How does magic affect your leads' relationship?**

Check any that apply:
- [ ] One has magic, the other doesn't (power imbalance)
- [ ] They have different/opposing types of magic
- [ ] Their magic connects them (bonds, shared power)
- [ ] One's magic is forbidden or feared
- [ ] Magic creates their obstacle (curse, prophecy, law)
- [ ] Magic forces their proximity (bonding, contract, spell)
- [ ] Using magic reveals vulnerability
- [ ] Their magic is stronger together

**Briefly explain how magic complicates or enables their romance:**

## 7. WHAT'S THE WORLD-LEVEL THREAT?

Your fantasy plot needs external stakes. What's wrong with the world that your characters will have to deal with?

**The threat could be:**

- **War:** Invasion, civil war, brewing conflict between nations
- **Political instability:** Succession crisis, coup, power vacuum
- **Magical crisis:** Magic failing, spreading curse, ancient evil awakening
- **Environmental:** Plague, famine, dying land, magical catastrophe
- **Social upheaval:** Revolution brewing, oppressed group rising, system collapsing

**What's the world-level problem in your story?**

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How does this problem connect to your romance?**

The best romantasy integrates the world threat with the love story. Consider:

- Does the threat force them together?
- Does it threaten to tear them apart?
- Do they need each other to solve it?
- Does solving it require sacrifice that affects their relationship?
- Are they on opposite sides of it?

**How your world-level threat connects to your romance:**

## 8. THE ONE-SENTENCE WORLD

Now put it together. You should be able to complete this sentence:

**"In a world where [brief setting/situation], [protagonist] and [love interest] are [forced together by X] but kept apart by [obstacle], while [world threat] threatens everything."**

Write your version:

## YOU'RE READY TO PLOT

With these elements established, you have enough worldbuilding foundation to work through the premise workbook. You know:

- Where your story takes place
- What forces your characters together
- What keeps them apart
- Who holds power and how they'd view this relationship
- What's forbidden and what the consequences are
- How magic affects the romance (if applicable)
- What external threat creates urgency

That's enough world to build a premise. You can always deepen these elements later using the full Romantasy Worldbuilding Workbook — but you don't need to answer every question about geography, economy, and religious holidays before you know what your story is about.

Some writers discover their world through plotting. Some discover their plot through worldbuilding. If you've filled out this quickstart, you've done enough worldbuilding to start.

Now go build your premise.
