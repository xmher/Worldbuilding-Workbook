# SECTION 12: Magic as Conflict Generator — Exercises

---

## Dangerous Power

**Is your character's magic dangerous to others? To themselves? To both?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can this danger be managed with training, or is it inherent to the magic itself? What does "control" look like — and what does losing control look like?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Has your character ever hurt someone with their magic? What happened, and how did it shape their relationship to their power?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the fear of causing harm affect how your character lets people close? What protective distance do they maintain — and what would make them risk closing it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would the love interest have to do or say to convince your character that the risk is worth taking? What proof would they need?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Forbidden or Hunted Magic

**Is your character's magic forbidden, illegal, or socially condemned? What are the consequences of being discovered — execution, imprisonment, exile, experimentation?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who knows about their abilities? Who absolutely cannot find out?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does your character have to do to hide their magic? What daily deceptions, limitations, or sacrifices does concealment require?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean to reveal their magic to the love interest? What's the worst-case outcome they fear? What's the hope they might not admit to?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If the love interest discovered the truth by accident rather than being told, how would that affect trust?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Secrets & Hidden Costs

**What does your character's magic cost them that others can't easily see? Physical toll, emotional burden, shortened lifespan, moral compromise?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do they hide this cost? Shame, protection of others, fear of being seen as weak, fear of being stopped?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would the love interest do if they discovered the hidden cost? Would they try to stop your character, share the burden, or respect the choice?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Oaths, Debts & Binding Agreements

**What promises in your world are magically enforced? What happens when they're broken?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is your character bound by any magical oath or agreement? What are the terms, and who holds the other end?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this binding create an obstacle to the romance — something they've promised that conflicts with what they want?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could a magical bargain be used *for* the romance — a binding that protects, legitimizes, or forces proximity? What would the terms be, and who would propose it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the most dangerous promise your character could make? What would push them to make it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Opposition & Incompatibility

**Do your characters' magical abilities conflict? What happens when they're used in close proximity — cancellation, amplification, volatility, pain?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is this opposition a permanent state or something that can be overcome with practice, trust, or sacrifice? What would it take?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does magical incompatibility mirror or contrast with their personal dynamic? Are they opposites in temperament too, or is the magical conflict at odds with their emotional compatibility?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If their magic is dangerous to combine, what circumstances might force them to try anyway? What would be worth the risk?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Power Imbalance

**Is there a significant power gap between your characters? Who holds more magical, political, or physical power?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the more powerful character have that the other wants or needs? What could they give — or withhold?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Now flip it: what does the "weaker" character have that the powerful one lacks? Knowledge, skills, connections, immunity, moral clarity, the ability to say no?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the power balance shift throughout your story? What moments give the less powerful character the upper hand?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would an outsider see when watching their dynamic? Would they be concerned? Are they right to be?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Magic Used Against Will

**Can your character's magic be used against their will? By whom and under what circumstances?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can your character's magic affect others without their consent? What are the ethical lines they've drawn — and have they ever crossed them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What magical violation exists in your world that your characters fear most — from others, or from themselves?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If one character used magic on the other in a morally gray moment — for protection, for information, in desperation — could the relationship survive it? What would repair require?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The World at War: Magic as Structural Pressure

### Magical Resources and Scarcity

**Does magic in your world require resources that can be controlled, hoarded, or fought over?**

Consider: Rare plants, minerals, or creatures used in spellwork. Ley lines or places of power that can be claimed. Magical artifacts from a lost age. Blood or life force. Access to training, texts, or teachers.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who controls magical resources in your world? Who's excluded from access?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are there active conflicts — wars, trade disputes, political maneuvering — over magical resources? How do these affect ordinary people?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How might resource scarcity or control put pressure on your leads' relationship?**

Consider: They're on opposite sides of a resource conflict. One of them controls something the other desperately needs. Their relationship threatens existing power structures. Staying together requires resources they can't access.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Magical Damage and Corruption

**Has magic damaged your world? Are there places, creatures, or people marked by magical catastrophe?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is magical corruption spreading, stable, or being healed? What would it take to fix the damage — and what would that cost?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters live with the consequences of magical damage? How does it affect their daily lives, their communities, their futures?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could magical corruption threaten your characters directly — their home, their people, their health, their powers?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Magical Arms Races

**Is there military or political competition to develop magical power in your world?**

Consider: Nations racing to train more war-mages. Factions seeking ancient weapons. Attempts to breed or create more powerful magic users. Magical espionage and stolen secrets.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the most dangerous magical weapon or capability in your world? Who has it, and who wants it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are your characters caught up in this competition? As weapons, as soldiers, as prizes, as targets?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How might magical militarization put pressure on the relationship?**

Consider: One or both characters are seen as assets rather than people. Their abilities make them valuable to factions who won't let them go. Falling in love creates a vulnerability enemies can exploit. Their duties put them on opposite sides.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Regulation, Control, and Resistance

**How does authority in your world attempt to control magic?**

Consider: Registration of magic users. Licensing and restriction of certain abilities. Conscription of powerful mages. Suppression of "dangerous" magic types. State monopoly on magical training. Taxation of magical goods and services.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who benefits from magical regulation? Who suffers under it?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there resistance to magical control? Underground magic users, rebel factions, hidden communities, black markets?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Where do your characters stand in relation to magical authority? Do they enforce it, suffer under it, resist it, exploit it, try to reform it?**

Protagonist: _______________________________________________________________

Love Interest: _______________________________________________________________

**How might their positions regarding magical authority create tension between them — or force them into alliance?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### History Repeating

**What major magical conflict shaped your world's recent history? (A war, a catastrophe, a revolution, a conquest?)**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does that conflict still affect the present? What resentments, imbalances, or unfinished business remain?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters come from different sides of this historical divide?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it take to truly resolve the old conflict — and is that resolution possible within your story, or is it the wound your world carries?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Bigger Pressure

**What external magical conflict puts the most pressure on your leads' relationship?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**At some point, will your characters have to choose between each other and the larger conflict? What does that choice look like?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If they ignore the world's problems to be together, what happens? Can they live with the consequences?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If they sacrifice their relationship to address the world's problems, what happens? Would either of them actually make that choice?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________
