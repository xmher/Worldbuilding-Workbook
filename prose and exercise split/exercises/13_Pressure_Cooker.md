# SECTION 13: The Pressure Cooker — Exercises

## The Core Principle: Why They Can't Leave

**Physical constraints** (geography, architecture, locked doors):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Obligation** (must complete a task, fulfill a contract, serve a sentence):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Danger** (can't survive alone, enemies surround them, wilderness is lethal):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Social/political requirements** (must maintain appearances, fulfill duties):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Economic necessity** (job requires it, only shelter available, debt binding them):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Magical binding** (curse, bond, spell requires proximity):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How long are they trapped together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they physically separate within the confined space?**

Can they retreat to separate rooms, or are they truly stuck in close quarters?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens if they try to leave or separate?**

Death? Failure? Social ruin? Magical backlash? Be specific about consequences.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Physical Pressure vs. Emotional Pressure

**Beyond physical constraints, what emotional stakes keep them there?**

Would leaving mean abandoning someone who needs them? Admitting defeat? Breaking a promise? Losing their only chance at something they need?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could either character technically leave but chooses to stay?**

If yes — why do they stay? What would leaving cost them emotionally?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would leaving say about them — to themselves and each other?**

Would it mean they're a coward? That they don't care? That they've given up?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment when one considers leaving but doesn't?**

What stops them — the physical constraints, or something deeper?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Your Pressure Cooker Setting

**What is your primary pressure cooker setting?**

(Reference: isolated locations from Section 1, institutional settings from Section 14)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Map the constraints:**

| Constraint Type | Specific Details |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Physical (size, layout, barriers) | |
| Temporal (how long they're stuck) | |
| Survival (needs that must be met) | |
| Social (who's watching, what's expected) | |
| Escape (what happens if they try to leave) | |

**What's the minimum physical distance they can maintain?**

Can they stay in separate buildings? Separate rooms? Or are they sharing space constantly?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Other People in the Pressure Cooker

**Who else is present in the confined setting?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How do others affect how the protagonists can interact?**

Must they hide their feelings? Maintain appearances? Compete for attention? Perform a relationship that isn't real (yet)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a rival for either character's attention?**

Someone else interested in one of them? A former lover present? Someone they're "supposed" to be with?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there an ally who helps them find private moments?**

Someone who covers for them, creates distractions, keeps secrets?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a threat — someone who would expose or harm them?**

Someone watching, someone who would report them, someone dangerous?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What can't they say or do because others are present?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when they're finally alone — truly alone — for the first time?**

After constant company, the first real privacy:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Forced Interaction Points

**Shared necessities:**

Meals (where, when, can they avoid eating together): ____________________

_______________________________________________________________

Sleep (same room, nearby rooms, can hear each other): __________________

_______________________________________________________________

Bathing/grooming (shared facilities, limited privacy): ___________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Required activities:**

Training, meetings, tasks, social events they must both attend:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Enforced cooperation:**

Tasks that specifically require them to work together:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What daily contact is absolutely unavoidable?**

What do they *have* to do together every single day?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Routines & Rhythms

**What daily routines develop in the confined space?**

Morning patterns: ________________________________________________

Meal times: _____________________________________________________

Work/training schedules: __________________________________________

Evening patterns: ________________________________________________

**What moment repeats daily that becomes meaningful?**

The same time of day they always cross paths? A shared task? A regular meal? A moment of quiet?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does a routine moment become ritual — something they both anticipate?**

What starts as obligation and becomes something they look forward to:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What changes when the routine is broken?**

If one day the pattern doesn't happen — what does that mean? What do they feel?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do they develop private rituals only they share?**

Something that becomes "theirs" within the larger routine:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Relief & Breathing Room

**When does the pressure temporarily release?**

Moments when they can be apart, when danger pauses, when they get privacy or solitude:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they do with moments of relief?**

Seek solitude? Seek each other? Process what's happening? Avoid thinking about it?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does relief feel different as the relationship develops?**

Early on, relief might mean escaping each other. Later, it might mean finding each other.

At first, relief means: _____________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Later, relief means: _______________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment when one seeks out the other during a relief period — when they didn't have to?**

The choice to be together when they could be apart:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What happens when relief is taken away?**

When even the small escapes disappear, and there's no break from the pressure:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Escalating the Pressure

**Initial proximity level:**

How close are they forced to be at the start?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What increases the pressure over time?**

Consider: Space gets smaller, time gets shorter, stakes get higher, others leave so they're more alone, danger increases, walls between them (literal or figurative) come down.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**The peak pressure moment:**

When proximity is most intense, most inescapable:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What finally releases the pressure?**

Do they escape? Complete the mission? Confess feelings? Get external rescue? Does the pressure cooker end, or do they transform within it?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## How Confinement Changes Them

**What does proximity reveal about each character that distance would have hidden?**

About the protagonist (habits, fears, kindness, flaws, vulnerabilities):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

About the love interest:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does stress bring out in each of them?**

Best qualities under pressure: ______________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

Worst qualities under pressure: _____________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What assumptions do they have to revise after seeing each other constantly?**

What did they think about the other that turns out to be wrong?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What vulnerability is impossible to hide in close quarters?**

Nightmares, illness, fear, grief, need, habits, weaknesses — what can't be concealed?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How are they different by the time the confinement ends?**

What has proximity taught them about themselves and each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Scaling Proximity

**Large scale: One region/journey**

The entire setting compresses them — they can't leave the territory, the ship, the caravan:

_______________________________________________________________

**Medium scale: One building/location**

Same structure, could theoretically avoid each other within it, but plot keeps forcing interaction:

_______________________________________________________________

**Small scale: One room/space**

Truly confined, no escape from each other's presence:

_______________________________________________________________

**The progression:**

How do you move from "can avoid each other" to "can't escape each other" over the course of your story?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Privacy Within Proximity

**Where can each character go to be alone (if anywhere)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How do they steal private moments together?**

Within a setting where others are watching, where do they find each other?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What's the risk of being caught alone together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**When do they have true privacy?**

Circumstances that allow them to be genuinely alone together — and what happens:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Integration Check

**What geographic features create your pressure cooker (from Section 1)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What institution binds them (from Section 14)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does magic create or prevent escape (from Section 10)?**

**Do cultural obligations force proximity (from Section 3)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How does technology level affect confinement (from Section 9)?**
