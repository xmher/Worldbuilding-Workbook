## The Rules You've Established

### Magic Rules

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System)

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

5. ____________________________________________________________

**Have you ever bent or broken these rules for plot convenience?**

If yes — was there an in-world explanation, or did you just need it to work differently?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Political/Legal Rules

(Reference: Section 5 — Government, Power & Law)

**What are the most important laws or political realities?**

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

**Have characters broken these laws without facing stated consequences?**

If yes — why didn't they face consequences? Will readers accept that reason?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Social/Cultural Rules

(Reference: Section 3 — Culture, Customs & Daily Life)

**What are the unbreakable customs or taboos?**

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

**Do characters violate these customs — and do others react appropriately?**

If a character breaks a taboo and no one reacts, readers notice.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Physical/Environmental Rules

(Reference: Section 1 — Geography; Section 9 — Technology)

## The "Would This Actually Happen?" Test

**Describe a key romantic scene:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Apply your rules:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| If guards patrol this area, where are they during this scene? | |
| If magic can detect lies/emotions/presence, why doesn't it detect this? | |
| If this location is dangerous, why hasn't the danger manifested? | |
| If discovery means severe punishment, why risk it here and now? | |
| If other characters would intervene, why don't they? | |

### The Reversal Test

**What would actually happen if they were caught?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who would catch them, and why haven't they?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a good in-world reason they don't get caught, or are you just protecting them?**

_______________________________________________________________

## The Convenience Check

### Powers and Abilities

**List your protagonist's key abilities:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**List your love interest's key abilities:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do abilities remain consistent in power level?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does anyone forget an ability that would solve the current problem?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Environmental Consistency

**Map key locations and travel times:**

| From | To | Travel Time |
|------|-----|-------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Have you changed these times for plot convenience?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do environmental dangers remain consistent?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Authority and Surveillance

**Are authority figures consistently present or absent?**

Do guards only patrol when you need tension, then vanish when you need privacy?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does surveillance (magical or mundane) work consistently?**

_______________________________________________________________

## The "Vibes vs. Logic" Problem

### Identifying Vibes-Over-Logic Moments

Check if you've done any of these:

☐ Magic with strict rules suddenly works differently for a romantic moment

☐ Political danger that drives the plot pauses completely for romantic scenes

☐ Characters have privacy in places that should be public or monitored

☐ Consequences you've established don't apply when protagonists break rules

☐ Worldbuilding obstacles disappear when they become inconvenient

☐ Characters forget abilities, knowledge, or resources that would help

**How many did you check?**

0-1: You're probably fine.
2-3: Review these specific instances.
4+: You have a pattern to address.

### Fixing Vibes-Over-Logic Problems

**Issue:** _____________________________________________________

**Which fix:** __________________________________________________

**Issue:** _____________________________________________________

**Which fix:** __________________________________________________

## Does the Fantasy Plot Pause for the Romance?

### The Timeline Test

**Outline major fantasy plot points and romantic beats chronologically:**

| Plot Point | Romantic Beat |
|------------|---------------|
| 1. | 1. |
| 2. | 2. |
| 3. | 3. |
| 4. | 4. |

**Do fantasy plot points stop advancing when romance heats up?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do romantic beats happen during plot events or in pauses between them?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Pressure Test

**For each major romantic moment, what external pressure is active?**

Ticking clock, pursuing enemy, deadline, magical countdown, someone who might discover them, limited time before forced separation, danger that could interrupt?

| Romantic Moment | Active External Pressure |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

### The Dual Clock

**Your fantasy plot deadline:**

(War reaches city, curse takes effect, prophecy deadline passes, trial concludes, army arrives)

_______________________________________________________________

**Your romantic plot deadline:**

(When they must make final choice about each other, point of no return for the relationship)

_______________________________________________________________

**Do these deadlines converge?**

_______________________________________________________________

If deadlines are separate, can you align them?

_______________________________________________________________

## Character Knowledge Consistency

### Information Tracking

**What does your protagonist know (and when did they learn it)?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does your love interest know (and when did they learn it)?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does protagonist know that love interest doesn't?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What does love interest know that protagonist doesn't?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Reveal Check

**Your major revelation or secret:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Could this character have figured this out earlier?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does any character act on information they shouldn't have yet?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Misunderstanding Check

**Your major misunderstanding:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Why don't they just ask each other directly?**

**Which applies to your story?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The Internal Logic Test

**Apply to your climax or major turning point:**

Event: _________________________________________________________

Setup Test — was this established? ________________________________

Rules Test — does this follow rules? _______________________________

Character Test — would they do this? ______________________________

---

## When to Break Your Own Rules

**Have you intentionally broken a rule?**

The rule: ______________________________________________________

Why you broke it: _______________________________________________

What makes it justified: _________________________________________

What consequences follow: _______________________________________

## The Consistency Checklist

Use this for any major plot point or romantic beat:

☐ Does this follow established magic rules?

☐ Does this follow established political/social rules?

☐ Are environmental conditions consistent with previous scenes?

☐ Do characters have only the knowledge and abilities they should have at this point?

☐ Are authority figures and obstacles present as established (or absent for good reason)?

☐ Does external plot pressure continue during this scene?

☐ If a rule is bent or broken, is there a clear in-world reason?

☐ Would readers who've been paying attention accept this?
