## The Removal Tests

### Test 1: Remove the Magic

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System)

**What magical element connects your characters?**

(Fated mate bond, telepathic link, shared magic, magical contract, curse, soul bond)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without this magic, do they still have reasons to interact?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without the magic, would they still be attracted to each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 2: Remove the Prophecy/Destiny

(Reference: Section 6 — Religion, Myth & Prophecy)

**What prophecy or destiny element affects your romance?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without the prophecy, do they still have reason to be together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Does prophecy create their connection, or confirm what would happen anyway?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 3: Remove the Political Pressure

(Reference: Section 5 — Government, Power & Law; Section 14 — Institutions)

**What political/institutional element forces them together?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Without this force, would they choose to spend time together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do they develop reasons to want to be together beyond obligation?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Test 4: Remove the Dangerous Situation

(Reference: Section 1 — Geography; Section 13 — Pressure Cooker)

**What external danger pushes them together?**

_______________________________________________________________

**In peacetime, with no danger, would they still connect?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is their bond only about survival, or does it include genuine emotional intimacy?**

_______________________________________________________________

## The Goal Test

**What does your protagonist want before the romance starts?**

(Concrete goal: escape, master magic, find family, survive, defeat enemy, gain freedom, prove themselves)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this goal still matter after they meet the love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the romance complicate their goal?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does falling for the protagonist complicate those goals?**

_______________________________________________________________

Other goals, relationships, purposes that would sustain them?

_______________________________________________________________

**Could your love interest walk away and still have a complete life?**

_______________________________________________________________

## The Choice Moment

**When does your protagonist actively choose the love interest?**

(Specific scene or decision point)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this choice cost them?**

(Safety, power, family approval, original goal, magic, freedom, identity, belonging)

_______________________________________________________________

**When does your love interest actively choose the protagonist?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What does this choice cost them?**

**Is there a moment where your character defies this force to be with their love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they risk in this defiance?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Making Agency Visible to Readers

**Does the narrative show characters considering alternatives?**

If they never think about other options, readers may not believe they had any.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do characters articulate their choice?**

A moment where they say (aloud or internally) that they're choosing this:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a moment where they could leave but visibly don't?**

Showing the open door they don't walk through:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do other characters acknowledge that they had a choice?**

Someone saying "you could have walked away" or "you didn't have to do this" confirms agency existed:

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the cost of their choice visible on the page?**

If choosing each other costs something, show what they lose or give up:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Consent Question

### Magical Bonds and Consent

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System, especially bonds)

**Did both characters consent to this bond?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If the bond formed without consent, can they reject it?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they tried to reject it?**

Nothing? Discomfort? Death? Loss of magic? Pain?

_______________________________________________________________

### The Consent Spectrum

**Where does your bond fall?**

_______________________________________________________________

**If low agency, how do you preserve choice within it?**

(They choose how to treat each other, whether to fight the pull, whether to act on it, what kind of relationship to build within the constraint)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Power Dynamic Check

(Reference: Section 5 — Power structures; Section 4 — Economic power)

### Mapping the Imbalance

**What power does the love interest have that the protagonist doesn't?**

(Political, physical, magical, wealth, knowledge, immortality, status, freedom)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What power does the protagonist have that the love interest doesn't?**

(Information, skills, moral leverage, emotional insight, ability to walk away, connections, knowledge)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the power dynamic shift during the story?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The "Can They Say No?" Test

**Can your protagonist say no to the love interest and have it respected?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Give a specific example of the protagonist saying "no" and it being respected:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**If the love interest has pressured or forced the protagonist, how does the story address this?**

Is it acknowledged as wrong? Are there consequences? Must they earn back trust? Or is it romanticized as "passionate"?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Captivity Scenario

**Is either character literally unable to leave?**

(Prisoner, hostage, magically trapped, indentured)

_______________________________________________________________

**If yes, how do you maintain agency within captivity?**

(Choices about cooperation/resistance, mental autonomy, romance doesn't begin until freedom exists or is possible, power dynamic is acknowledged and actively dismantled)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**When does the captive gain ability to leave — and what do they choose?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The "Why These Two?" Test

**Why would your protagonist be attracted to this specific person?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the love interest have that no one else has — that matters to the protagonist specifically?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does the protagonist have that matters uniquely to the love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they see in each other that no one else sees?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Beyond attraction, why do they work together as partners?**

(Balance each other, challenge each other, share values, understand each other's pain, complement each other's strengths)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## The Alternative Path Test

**What other romantic option exists for your protagonist?**

(Another character, choosing to be alone, a safer/easier relationship)

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do they reject this alternative?**

(Must be a character-driven reason, not just "the bond says so")

_______________________________________________________________

**What other option exists for your love interest?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Why do they reject it?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there an easier, safer option than being together?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Agency in the Ending

**Do your characters shape their own ending, or does the plot deliver it to them?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a final choice they make that determines the outcome?**

Not just "the villain is defeated and now they're together" but an active decision they make:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Could the ending have gone differently if they'd chosen differently?**

If the ending was inevitable regardless of their choices, they didn't have meaningful agency.

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they choose in the final act that proves they're choosing each other?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is the happy ending earned through their choices, or granted by external forces?**

Earned: They made sacrifices, took risks, chose each other actively despite cost.
Granted: The curse just lifted, the prophecy completed itself, the villain conveniently died.

_______________________________________________________________

## Agency in Cultural Context

(Reference: Section 3 — Culture; Section 5 — Government)

**In your world, how much choice do people typically have about their lives and relationships?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is having any choice at all radical in your setting?**

In highly controlled societies, small acts of choice carry enormous weight.

_______________________________________________________________

**What does choosing each other mean within your world's context?**

In some worlds, refusing an arranged marriage is revolutionary. In others, it's ordinary.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Are your characters' acts of agency appropriately weighted for your world?**

Small choices in oppressive worlds can be as powerful as dramatic choices in free ones.

_______________________________________________________________

**Do readers from our world need context to understand why their choices matter?**

If choice is rare in your world, make sure readers understand what choosing costs.

_______________________________________________________________

## The Agency Checklist

For strong character agency, you should be able to check most of these:

☐ If I removed all magical bonds/prophecy, they'd still be attracted to each other

☐ Both characters have goals and identity outside the romance

☐ There's a specific moment where each actively chooses the other

☐ This choice costs them something significant

☐ Both characters can (and do) say "no" to each other and have it respected

☐ The less powerful character has meaningful agency within the power dynamic

☐ They have reasons to choose each other beyond "fate says so"

☐ Both resist the relationship at some point before choosing it

☐ Alternatives exist that they consciously reject

☐ Readers can see the choice on the page (not just author intention)

☐ The ending is shaped by their choices, not delivered by plot convenience

**Score:**

8-11 checked: Strong agency — characters are genuinely choosing each other
5-7 checked: Moderate — some elements need strengthening
0-4 checked: Agency problems — worldbuilding may be overriding genuine choice
