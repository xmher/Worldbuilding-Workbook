## LOCATION: _____________________________________________

### The Physical Space

**Describe the location in 2-3 sentences. What's the dominant impression?**

(Think: size, lighting, temperature, sounds, smells, textures)

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What sensory details would your characters notice most?**

What they see: __________________________________________________

What they hear: _________________________________________________

What they smell: ________________________________________________

What they feel (temperature, texture, air): ___________________________

### Physical Constraints

**What does this space force or prevent?**

| Force (what must happen) | Prevent (what can't happen) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

**What features define the space?**

Size/layout: ____________________________________________________

Exits/entrances: _________________________________________________

Barriers/obstacles: _______________________________________________

Dangerous elements: _____________________________________________

**What makes this location difficult to reach or leave?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Privacy & Risk

**How private is this location?**

☐ Completely private — no chance of interruption

☐ Semi-private — could be interrupted but unlikely

☐ Risky — interruption is possible at any moment

☐ Public — others are present or could arrive

**Who else could be here? Who has access?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What would happen if they were discovered here together?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Can they see/hear someone approaching, or could they be surprised?**

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Enables

**What can happen here that couldn't happen elsewhere?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What comfort, safety, or resource does this location provide?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What intimacy does the space allow?**

Physical (can they touch, stand close, be comfortable):

_______________________________________________________________

Emotional (can they speak freely, show vulnerability):

_______________________________________________________________

### What This Location Prevents or Denies

**What intimacy is impossible here — and why?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What do they want that this location won't allow?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Time and Atmosphere

**How does this location change at different times?**

Dawn: _________________________________________________________

Midday: _______________________________________________________

Dusk: _________________________________________________________

Night: _________________________________________________________

**What time does the pivotal scene happen, and why that time?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How might weather transform this space?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is weather significant in the scene that happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

### History & Memory

(Reference Section 7 for your world's history)

**What happened in this place before your characters arrive?**

Has this location witnessed significant events? What ghosts linger?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do your characters know the history of this place?**

Does knowledge of the past affect how they feel here?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does this location have personal significance to either character?**

A place from their past, a meaningful memory, somewhere they've been before?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Moment

**What pivotal moment happens here?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Why must it happen HERE specifically?**

What about this location makes the moment possible, inevitable, or more meaningful?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## Locations That Recur

### Designing a Recurring Location

**If characters return to a location, what changes between visits?**

| Visit | Relationship State | What's Different |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| First visit | | |
| Second visit | | |
| Third visit | | |
| Final visit | | |

**What do they notice on return that they missed before?**

Details that only matter now, things that look different in light of what's happened:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does their behavior in this space change?**

Where they stand, how close, what they're comfortable doing:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the location itself change, or only their perception of it?**

Physical changes (seasons, damage, decay, growth) vs. emotional changes (what it means to them):

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### "Their" Place

**Do your characters have a location that becomes specifically theirs?**

A place they return to, where significant moments keep happening:

_______________________________________________________________

**How does it become theirs?**

Through repetition? A significant first moment there? A private ritual they develop?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What would it mean to lose access to this place?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Lost Locations

**Is there a location that becomes inaccessible to your characters?**

Destroyed, transformed, forbidden, too dangerous, claimed by enemies, sealed by magic?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What did this location mean to them?**

What happened there? What did it represent? What possibility did it hold?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does losing access to this place affect them?**

Grief? Loss of sanctuary? Loss of possibility? Motivation for action?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there something they wish they'd done there — but now can't?**

A conversation never had, a moment never taken, a chance lost:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the lost location exist only in memory by the end?**

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Location as Character

**Does your location seem to have a will or character of its own?**

A house that feels welcoming or hostile, a forest that seems to lead them somewhere, a room that holds secrets:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How does the location "respond" to the characters?**

Does it seem to help them (convenient shelter, paths that lead where they need)? Resist them (doors that stick, paths that mislead)? Reveal things to them (hidden rooms, unexpected views)?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What personality would you give this location if it were a character?**

Protective, threatening, indifferent, playful, melancholy, ancient, patient?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Cross-Location Connections

### Variety Check

**Do your locations offer different types of pressure and intimacy?**

Look at your key locations. Do you have a mix of:

☐ Public vs. private

☐ Dangerous vs. safe

☐ Forced proximity vs. chosen meeting

☐ Beautiful vs. harsh

☐ Familiar vs. unknown

☐ Their territory vs. neutral ground vs. enemy territory

**If several locations feel similar, how could you change one for more contrast?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Movement Between Locations

**How do characters move between locations?**

Travel together or separately? Is the journey itself significant?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Does the transition between locations matter?**

The walk from the ballroom to the garden, the journey from the city to the wilderness, the climb from the base of the tower to the top:

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### The Arc of Locations

**How do your locations progress through the story?**

Do they move from public to private? Safe to dangerous? Familiar to unknown? Constraint to freedom?

Beginning locations: ______________________________________________

Middle locations: ________________________________________________

Climax location: _________________________________________________

Resolution location: ______________________________________________

---

## The Final Location

**Where does the romantic climax happen?**

The moment of greatest emotional vulnerability, final confession, or decisive choice:

_______________________________________________________________

**Why is this the right place for this moment?**

Does it echo earlier locations? Represent how far they've come? Offer something they've never had before? Force a final confrontation they've been avoiding?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**How is this location different from where they started?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Integration Check

**How do your key locations connect to your geography (Section 1)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do any locations have significant flora/fauna (Section 2)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What cultural significance do locations carry (Section 3)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What historical weight do locations hold (Section 7)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**How does technology affect these spaces (Section 9)?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do any locations exist within institutions (Section 14)?**
