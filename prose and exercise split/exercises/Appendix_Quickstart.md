# APPENDIX: WORLDBUILDING QUICKSTART — Exercises

---

## 1. WHERE DOES THIS STORY HAPPEN?

**What's the scope of your world?**

| Scale | What It Looks Like | Best For |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Single location** | An academy, palace, ship, isolated estate, besieged castle | Tight focus, forced proximity, limited cast |
| **Single region** | One kingdom, territory, or city-state | Political intrigue, local stakes, concentrated power |
| **Multiple nations** | Several kingdoms or territories in conflict or alliance | Enemies-to-lovers across battle lines, diplomatic marriages |
| **Epic scope** | Continents, worlds, or realms | World-ending stakes, journeys, culture clashes |

**Check the scale that fits your story:** _______________________________________________

**Name your primary location(s):** _______________________________________________

**What's the general vibe of this place?** (Dark and dangerous? Glittering but corrupt? War-torn? Rigidly controlled? Lawless?)

## 2. WHO HAS POWER?

**What type of government exists?** (Monarchy, empire, theocracy, council, feudal system, tribal, something else?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Who currently rules?** (Even a vague answer helps — "a young queen," "a council of mages," "no one; it's chaos")

_______________________________________________________________________________

**How did they get power?** (Birthright, conquest, election, magic, religious authority?)

## 4. MAGIC (If Applicable)

**The Core Questions:**

**1. Who has magic?**
(Everyone? A special few? One specific group or bloodline? Certain species only?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**2. What can magic do — and what can't it do?**
(Be specific about limits. Unlimited magic is boring magic.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________________

**3. What does magic cost?**
(Energy, pain, years of life, sanity, something else? Free magic has no stakes.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**4. How does society view magic users?**
(Revered, feared, controlled, hunted, ordinary?)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**5. How does magic intersect with power?**
(Do magic users rule? Are they controlled by rulers? Is magic regulated by law?)

## 7. WHAT KEEPS THEM APART?

**Common barriers:**
