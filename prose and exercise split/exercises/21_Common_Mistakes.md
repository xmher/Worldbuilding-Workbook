# APPENDIX: Common Romantasy Worldbuilding Mistakes — Quick Self-Check

---

## Quick Self-Check

Before you finish your draft, run through this checklist:

☐ Can the romance happen ONLY in this world, or could it happen anywhere?

☐ Do your magic/political/cultural rules stay consistent throughout?

☐ Does danger actually hurt anyone, or is it all near-misses?

☐ Could you explain why your characters choose each other without mentioning fate or magic?

☐ Do consequences that are threatened actually happen?

☐ If one character has power over the other, do they ever genuinely have the option to leave?

☐ Does the fantasy plot matter independently of the romance?

☐ Would removing the romance leave a functional story? Would removing the fantasy leave a functional story?

☐ Does your world feel real beyond the main characters?

☐ Have you ever broken your own rules for convenience?

If you answered "no" or "not sure" to any of these, go back and address it. These are the mistakes that separate forgettable romantasy from the books readers remember.
