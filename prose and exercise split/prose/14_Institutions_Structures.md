# SECTION 14: Institutions & Structures

Institutions aren't just settings — they're systems designed to control, rank, test, and bind people. In romantasy, the right institution becomes a pressure cooker: it forces your characters into proximity, creates hierarchies they must navigate, and establishes consequences that make leaving impossible or dangerous.

The beauty of institutional settings is that they come with built-in rules, schedules, and power structures. Characters can't just walk away from an academy mid-semester or abandon a military post during wartime. The institution creates the container; your job is to make sure that container compresses your characters together.

This section builds on the political structures from Section 5 (Government), the cultural expectations from Section 3 (Culture), and the economic bindings from Section 4 (Economy). Here, we focus on how specific institutions function as romantic pressure systems.

## Types of Institutional Settings

Institutions come in many forms. Some stories use a single institution; others combine elements. Before diving into specifics, identify what type of institution shapes your story:

---

## The Academy/Training Ground

The academy setting is romantasy gold because it combines forced proximity, competitive rankings, and high stakes in one package.

### Why Academies Work

---

## Courts & Palaces

Court settings trade physical danger for social danger. Every word is scrutinized, every glance noted. Courts are excellent for slow-burn because intimacy must be stolen in brief moments.

(Note: For the political structure of courts, see Section 5. Here we focus on court as a romantic pressure cooker.)

### Why Courts Work

---

## Military & War Settings

War accelerates everything. The threat of death strips away pretense, and "we might die tomorrow" becomes catalyst for intimacy.

(Note: For warfare's political dimensions, see Section 5. Here we focus on military settings as romantic pressure cookers.)

### Why War Works

---

## Religious Institutions

Temples, monasteries, and religious orders create unique pressure: vows that conflict with desire, sacred duties that demand sacrifice, communities where devotion is expected to eclipse personal attachment.

(Note: For religious doctrine and beliefs, see Section 6. Here we focus on religious institutions as romantic pressure cookers.)

---

## Economic & Labor Institutions

Guilds, apprenticeships, indentured service, and debt bondage create obligation that binds as tightly as any lock.

(Note: For economic systems generally, see Section 4. Here we focus on how economic institutions trap characters together.)

---

## Healing & Care Institutions

Hospitals, asylums, and recovery spaces create vulnerability by design. One person is weak; the other provides care. The intimacy of illness and healing is unique.

---

## Arranged Marriages & Political Alliances

The arranged marriage forces intimacy before trust. Strangers must navigate domesticity, physical closeness, and political pressure simultaneously.

(Note: For marriage laws and customs, see Sections 3 and 5. Here we focus on arranged marriage as a romantic pressure cooker.)

---

## Institutional Ideals vs. Reality

Every institution claims to serve a purpose. The gap between what it claims and what it does creates story opportunity.

---

## Gaming the System

Every institution has people who know how to work it — and people who suffer under it.

---

## The Diagnostic Question

For whatever institution you've chosen:

**If my characters tried to walk away right now, what would stop them?**

If the answer is "nothing" or "they'd feel bad," your institution doesn't have enough grip.

**Strong answers sound like:**
- They'd be executed for desertion
- The magical bond would kill them both
- Their families would go to war
- They'd lose their only chance at survival/power/freedom
- The enemy would capture them immediately
- They'd be stripped of their magic and exiled
- Their people would be slaughtered without the alliance
- They'd be hunted as oath-breakers

**Weak answers sound like:**
- They'd feel guilty
- It would be awkward
- Someone might be disappointed

## Final Thought: The Institution Is a Character

The best institutional settings feel alive — with their own rules, culture, corruption, and demands. The institution should press on your characters constantly, shaping what they can do, say, and feel.

Characters don't just exist within institutions; they're shaped by them, rebel against them, find cracks in them, and ultimately either escape them or change them.

Design an institution with enough grip that your characters can't just walk away — and then watch them try anyway. The institution creates the pressure; your characters' responses reveal who they really are.
