# APPENDIX: WORLDBUILDING QUICKSTART

## For Writers Who Want to Build Before They Plot

Some writers need to know their world before they can find their story. If you're one of them, this appendix gives you the essential worldbuilding decisions that directly feed into premise development.

This isn't meant to replace the full Romantasy Worldbuilding Workbook — it's a fast-track version focused on the elements that generate conflict, stakes, and romantic obstacles. Once you've worked through your premise, you can always return to the complete workbook to deepen what you've established here.

**The goal:** Build just enough world to know what's keeping your characters apart and what's forcing them together.

# PART ONE: THE WORLD

These questions establish the fantasy foundation — the setting, power structures, magic, and threats that exist regardless of your romance.

---

## 1. WHERE DOES THIS STORY HAPPEN?

Before you can write conflict, you need to know what kind of container your story lives in.

---

## 2. WHO HAS POWER?

Understanding your world's power structure tells you what your characters are up against — and what they might gain or lose through their choices.

---

## 4. MAGIC (If Applicable)

Skip this section if your story doesn't include magic.

---

## 5. WORLD-LEVEL THREAT

Your fantasy plot needs external stakes. What's wrong with the world that your characters will have to deal with?

**The threat could be:**

- **War:** Invasion, civil war, brewing conflict between nations
- **Political instability:** Succession crisis, coup, power vacuum
- **Magical crisis:** Magic failing, spreading curse, ancient evil awakening
- **Environmental:** Plague, famine, dying land, magical catastrophe
- **Social upheaval:** Revolution brewing, oppressed group rising, system collapsing

# PART TWO: HOW THE WORLD AFFECTS THE ROMANCE

Now that you've established your world's foundation, these questions connect that world to your love story.

---

## 6. WHAT FORCES THEM TOGETHER?

Romantasy runs on proximity — characters who could simply walk away from each other rarely generate enough tension to sustain a novel. Based on the world you've built, what circumstances force your leads into each other's orbit?

**Common proximity drivers:**

- **Institutional:** They're both at the same academy, court, military unit, or organization
- **Geographic:** They're trapped by weather, terrain, siege, or journey
- **Political:** Diplomatic mission, arranged marriage, peace negotiation, hostage situation
- **Professional:** They must work together toward a shared goal
- **Magical:** A bond, curse, or prophecy ties them together
- **Circumstantial:** They're the only survivors, only ones who know the truth, or only ones who can complete the task

---

## 7. WHAT KEEPS THEM APART?

Equally important: what obstacles prevent them from simply getting together? Your world should make their union difficult, forbidden, or seemingly impossible.

---

## YOU'RE READY TO PLOT

With these elements established, you have enough worldbuilding foundation to work through the premise workbook. You know:

- Where your story takes place
- Who holds power and what threatens them
- What social divisions and expectations exist
- How magic works (if applicable)
- What external threat creates urgency
- What forces your characters together
- What keeps them apart
- What's forbidden and what the consequences are

That's enough world to build a premise. You can always deepen these elements later using the full Romantasy Worldbuilding Workbook — but you don't need to answer every question about geography, economy, and religious holidays before you know what your story is about.

Some writers discover their world through plotting. Some discover their plot through worldbuilding. If you've filled out this quickstart, you've done enough worldbuilding to start.

Now go build your premise.
