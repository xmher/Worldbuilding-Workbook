# SECTION 18: The Agency Check

The most powerful romantasy stories are those where characters choose each other despite everything — not because magic forces them, not because prophecy demands it, not because they have no other option. The worldbuilding creates pressure, obstacles, and opportunities, but at the end of the day, the characters must have agency.

Agency means the ability to make meaningful choices. In romance, this is crucial: readers need to believe that these two people genuinely want each other, not that they're biologically compelled, magically bound without consent, or politically trapped with no alternatives.

But here's the challenge: romantasy often includes elements that seem to override choice. Fated mates. Prophecies. Magical bonds. Arranged marriages. These are popular tropes because they create instant stakes and force proximity — but they can accidentally strip characters of agency if you're not careful.

This section helps you test whether your worldbuilding supports character agency or undermines it.

## Understanding the Agency Paradox

In romantasy, you often want two contradictory things:

**You want:** The relationship to feel destined, inevitable, cosmically significant

**You also want:** The characters to freely choose each other

The best romantasy makes the answer: **"Both."**

The magic/fate/world pushes them together, but they still have to choose to stay. The bond is real, but they have to decide whether to accept it. The prophecy says they're meant to be, but they could still walk away — and what makes the story powerful is that they don't.

**The key question:** If you removed all external pressure, would they still choose each other?

If the answer is no, you have an agency problem.

## The Removal Tests

These tests help you determine whether your romance depends on worldbuilding pressure or whether the connection is genuine.

### Test 1: Remove the Magic

If yes: Good. Magic enhances but doesn't replace organic connection.
If no: You're relying too heavily on magic to do the work of building connection.

### Test 2: Remove the Prophecy/Destiny

Best answer: It confirms. They fall in love organically; prophecy is validation, not cause.

### Test 3: Remove the Political Pressure

Good answer: They start together because they have to, stay because they want to.

### Test 4: Remove the Dangerous Situation

## The Goal Test

Characters with agency have desires that exist independently of the romance.

If abandoned entirely: Character may have lost agency. Romance consumed their identity.
If it still matters: Good. They're a full person with their own life.

Best: Romance and goal conflict, forcing hard choices.

### The "Walking Away" Question

If both answers are "yes," then when they choose to stay, it means something. They're choosing each other over viable alternatives.

---

## The Choice Moment

There should be a specific moment where characters actively choose the relationship — not passively accept what fate decided.

### The "Defying the World" Moment

This defiance is proof of agency — making their own choice against the world's rules.

## Making Agency Visible to Readers

It's not enough for agency to exist in your mind — readers need to see it on the page.

## The Consent Question

### Magical Bonds and Consent

### The Consent Spectrum

**Highest agency:** Bond can be rejected with no consequences. They choose to accept it.

**High agency:** Bond can be rejected at moderate cost. They weigh options and choose.

**Moderate agency:** Bond can be rejected at significant cost. Choice is hard but real.

**Low agency:** Bond cannot be rejected without death or destruction. No choice about the bond, but choice remains in how they live within it.

**No agency:** Bond controls feelings and actions. They cannot choose differently. (This is non-consensual and problematic unless the story is explicitly about breaking free.)

## The Power Dynamic Check

(Reference: Section 5 — Power structures; Section 4 — Economic power)

### The Captivity Scenario

If they never gain this ability, the romance is fundamentally non-consensual.

## The "Why These Two?" Test

Beyond any magical or political pressure — this is about the organic, character-driven reasons these two people belong together.

## The Agency Repair Kit

### If the magical bond is doing too much:

- **Add friction:** Even with a bond, they don't automatically like each other. They have to choose to work with it.
- **Add cost to acceptance:** Accepting the bond means giving something up. The choice has weight.
- **Show choosing within the bond:** They control whether to act on it, how they treat each other, what kind of relationship they build.

### If prophecy is removing agency:

- **Make it vague:** Prophecy says they're connected but not how or what it means.
- **Make it resistible:** They can fight it. Maybe it's even wrong. Prophecy is suggestion, not command.
- **Make it a late reveal:** They fall in love first, then discover prophecy validates what already happened.

### If political pressure is removing agency:

- **Give them the option to escape — and show them choosing to stay** for their own reasons.
- **Show them making the arrangement meaningful:** It started political; they chose to make it real.
- **Add genuine choice within the forced situation:** How they treat each other is still their choice.

### If power imbalance is removing agency:

- **Give the less powerful character leverage** — something the powerful one needs.
- **Show the powerful character restraining their power** — choosing not to use it.
- **Address the imbalance explicitly:** Characters acknowledge it and actively work to create equality.

## Final Thought: Choice Is What Makes It Love

Magic can bring them together. Prophecy can suggest they're meant to be. Political pressure can force proximity. Danger can create intimacy.

But at the end of the story, they need to choose each other freely — despite the cost, despite the alternatives, despite the easier paths available, because of who they are and what they've discovered in each other.

That choice is what makes the romance feel earned.

That choice is what separates "they ended up together" from "they chose each other."

That choice is what makes it love.
