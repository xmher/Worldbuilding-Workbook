# SECTION 15: Designing Your Key Locations

You don't need to map every corner of your world. What you need are 3-5 carefully designed locations where pivotal romantic moments happen — places that do narrative work.

A great romantasy location isn't just a pretty backdrop. It's a space with specific constraints that either force connection or make intimacy dangerous. The best locations have physical details that create story pressure: a narrow bridge where they must press close to pass, a garden where anyone might overhear, a cave where darkness strips away defenses.

This section is a workshop. You've built geography (Section 1), established how the natural world works (Section 2), and identified institutions that trap your characters (Section 14). Now you're going to design the specific locations where your romance unfolds — the rooms, gardens, battlefields, and hidden corners where the important moments happen.

## Why Location Design Matters

**Location isn't just "where something happens" — it's part of why it happens.**

A confession in a crowded ballroom means something different than a confession in a private garden. A kiss on a battlefield carries different weight than a kiss in a bedroom. The space shapes what's possible, what's risky, and what it means.

Consider how location affects:

**Physical possibility** — What can characters do in this space? What's impossible?

**Privacy and risk** — Who might see? What are the consequences of discovery?

**Emotional resonance** — What does this place mean to them? What memories does it hold?

**Symbolic weight** — Does the location mirror or contrast with the emotional moment?

## Identifying Your Pivotal Moments

Before designing locations, identify the moments that need them.

### Matching Moments to Locations

For each moment, consider: Does this scene *need* a specific location, or could it happen anywhere?

If it could happen anywhere, you have a location problem. The best scenes are shaped by where they happen.

## What Makes a Location Work

Before designing specific locations, understand what makes locations effective in romantasy.

### Locations That Force Connection

Some spaces push characters together whether they want it or not:

- **Narrow spaces** — Corridors, bridges, paths where they must stand close
- **Shared resources** — One fire, one water source, one shelter
- **Dangerous surroundings** — Safety requires staying together
- **Limited seating/standing room** — Must be near each other
- **Tasks requiring cooperation** — Work that needs two people

### Locations That Enable Intimacy

Some spaces allow moments that wouldn't be possible elsewhere:

- **Privacy** — No witnesses, ability to speak freely
- **Beauty** — Setting that creates romantic atmosphere
- **Comfort** — Warmth, safety, permission to relax
- **Liminal spaces** — Between places, outside normal rules
- **Neutral ground** — Neither's territory, both somewhat vulnerable

### Locations That Create Risk

Some spaces make intimacy dangerous:

- **Public but feels private** — Could be seen at any moment
- **Enemy territory** — Being discovered means death
- **Sacred spaces** — Intimacy here is transgression
- **Watched spaces** — Someone is always observing
- **Time-limited** — They'll be interrupted soon

### Locations That Reveal Character

Some spaces show us who characters really are:

- **Their home territory** — Seeing where they come from
- **Their workplace** — Seeing them in their element
- **Under stress** — How they act in dangerous locations
- **In comfort** — Who they are when they can relax

## Location Template

Use this template for each key location. The questions are designed to help you think through how the location affects your scene.

## Locations That Recur

Some locations appear multiple times in a story. Each return should feel different because the characters and relationship have changed.

### Designing a Recurring Location

---

## Lost Locations

Some significant places are lost — destroyed, changed, or closed forever. The loss of a meaningful location carries weight.

---

## Location as Character

The best locations feel alive — not just as settings but as presences that affect the characters. A location can have personality, mood, even a kind of agency.

## Cross-Location Connections

## The Final Location

## The Location Test

A well-designed location does at least two of these:

☐ **Forces physical proximity** (must stand close, touch, share space)

☐ **Creates danger requiring cooperation** (must work together to survive)

☐ **Provides privacy for vulnerability** (can finally speak freely)

☐ **Makes intimacy risky** (discovery would have consequences)

☐ **Offers something one character needs** (forcing them into other's domain)

☐ **Mirrors emotional state** (space reflects their bond)

☐ **Changes meaning as relationship evolves** (same place, different significance)

☐ **Has history that resonates** (past events echo in present moment)

**For each of your key locations, check at least two boxes.**

If a location doesn't do at least two of these things, revise: add a constraint, raise stakes, build in history, adjust symbolism.

## Final Thought: Locations Work for the Story

Every key location should be doing narrative work. It's not just where something happens — it's part of *why* it happens.

The space should constrain, enable, reveal, or transform. It should make moments possible that couldn't happen elsewhere, or make possible moments dangerous in ways they wouldn't be elsewhere.

If you can move a scene to any other location and nothing changes, the location isn't working hard enough. But if the scene could *only* happen here — because of the privacy, the danger, the history, the physical constraints — then you've designed a location that matters.

Design places that readers will remember because the space itself was part of the story. The best romantic moments don't just happen *in* locations — they happen *because of* them.
