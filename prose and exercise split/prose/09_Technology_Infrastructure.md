# SECTION 9: Technology & Infrastructure

## Prose

---

Technology level determines what's possible and what's difficult. Can people communicate instantly across distances, or do letters take weeks? Can they travel in hours, or does separation mean months apart? Does infrastructure exist to support large populations, or is survival a daily struggle?

**Technology does three crucial things in romantasy:**

1. **Sets the pace of life** — How much time do people spend on survival vs. leisure? Who has time for anything beyond work?
2. **Determines connection and separation** — Travel speed and communication methods define what distance means
3. **Creates or removes obstacles** — Technology can solve problems (or its absence creates them)

The key is understanding what your tech level makes easy and what it makes hard. Don't get lost in technical details. Focus on how technology shapes daily life, what it enables, and what it prevents.

---

## Overall Technology Level

Technology may be consistent across your world, or it may vary by region. Advanced regions and less advanced regions may coexist, and the reasons for that disparity shape the world's dynamics. The relationship between magic and technology is also critical: does magic replace technology, coexist alongside it, stunt technological development, or enhance it?

---

## Transportation

Transportation methods -- from walking to magical transport -- vary in speed, cost, and accessibility. What matters most is how travel time and difficulty affect the story: how long it takes between important locations, what makes travel difficult or dangerous (weather, terrain, bandits, creatures, cost, physical demands), and who has access to faster methods.

---

## Travel Infrastructure

Roads, bridges, ports, way stations, inns, caravanserais, stables -- travel infrastructure determines what's possible. Who maintains it (government, local lords, guilds, or no one) and what happens where it doesn't exist both shape the world.

---

## Communication

Communication methods over distance -- hand-delivered letters, courier systems, messenger birds, signal systems, magical communication, technological solutions -- vary in speed, reliability, cost, and privacy. How long messages take, whether they can be lost, delayed, intercepted, or altered, and what's the most secure and fastest way to communicate all matter for the story.

---

## Privacy & Surveillance

How private domestic spaces are -- wall thickness, separate rooms, who shares space -- directly affects what characters can do and say. Locks, access to private spaces (servants, family members, landlords, officials), and surveillance (magical scrying, spy networks, informants) all shape the story's possibilities. Where people can have truly private conversations, and the consequences of being overheard, create tension.

---

## Servants & Domestic Labor

In many historical and fantasy settings, wealthy households include servants who see and hear everything. What servants do (cooking, cleaning, dressing, attending, managing households), what they see and hear (are they present for private moments, do they handle personal items, do they sleep nearby), the relationship between servants and employers, and whether servants can be trusted with secrets all shape the world. The presence of servants directly affects what characters can do privately.

---

## Time & Labor

How much time ordinary people spend on survival tasks -- food preparation, water collection, heating/fuel, cleaning/maintenance -- determines the pace of daily life. Who does this labor (servants, women, lower classes, everyone, magical solutions) and how much leisure time exists for different classes shape the world's rhythms. The disparity in free time between characters of different classes can significantly affect a relationship.

---

## Medicine & Healing

Medical knowledge determines what conditions are treatable and what outcomes are possible. Who provides medical care (physicians, healers, midwives, herbalists, magical healers, family members) and what determines access (cost, location, class, connections) create the stakes around injury and illness. Whether magical healing exists, how common and effective it is, what it can't heal, and its cost or limitations all matter. Understanding what injuries or illnesses are survivable vs. fatal, and what chronic conditions exist, grounds the story in reality.

---

## Contraception & Reproduction

Contraception availability -- herbal/natural methods, barrier methods, timing/withdrawal, magical prevention -- shapes relationships and consequences. Who has access to contraception (available to all, expensive, forbidden, requires specific knowledge, class-dependent) and what happens if it fails or isn't used (social, legal, and practical consequences) are important. Pressure to produce heirs and fertility issues add further dimensions.

---

## Documentation & Records

What documentation exists -- birth records, death records, marriage records, identity documents, property records, legal contracts -- and who keeps them determines how identity and relationships are officially recognized. How people prove identity, what makes a marriage legally valid and provable, what happens without documentation, and whether documents can be falsified all create story possibilities.

---

## Lighting

How people light their spaces (candles, oil lamps, torches, magical light, gas, electricity) and how expensive lighting is determine what nighttime looks like. Whether everyone can afford to stay up after dark or darkness is the norm for the poor shapes daily rhythms. What can and can't be done after dark creates opportunity and constraint.

---

## Heating & Cooling

Fireplaces, central heating, braziers, body heat, magical warmth for cold; fans, shade, water, magical cooling, architectural solutions for heat. Extreme temperatures can be dangerous, and how people survive them shapes the world.

---

## Water & Sanitation

How people get clean water (wells, rivers, aqueducts, pumps, magical purification), how they bathe (public bathhouses, private baths, rivers/lakes, basins, or rarely), and what sanitation exists (sewers, chamber pots, outhouses, magical waste disposal) all have health implications -- disease, cleanliness, and daily routines.

---

## Food & Preservation

Food preservation methods (salting, smoking, drying, pickling, cold storage, magical preservation) affect daily life: whether fresh food is required daily, seasonal eating patterns, and long-term storage. Food availability varies by class.

---

## Clothing & Textiles

What materials clothes are made from, how they're made (hand-sewn, tailored, mass-produced), and how complicated getting dressed is (whether people can dress themselves or need help) all affect daily life. Clothing signals class and status.

---

## Weapons & Warfare Technology

The weapons that exist -- melee, ranged, siege, magical -- along with armor and the most advanced military technology determine the nature of conflict. Who has access to weapons (restricted to military/nobility, commonly owned, forbidden to certain groups) shapes the power dynamics.

---

## Information & Education

What people write on and with, how books are made (hand-copied, printed, magically reproduced), how expensive and rare books are, and who can access education (universal, class-restricted, gender-restricted) all shape knowledge and literacy in the world.

---

## Timekeeping

How people tell time (sun position, bells, clocks, magical timekeepers), how precise timekeeping is (to the hour, quarter-hour, or minute), and whether people schedule precisely or approximately affects the rhythm of daily life and coordination.

---

## Construction & Architecture

Building materials, construction techniques, how tall buildings can be, and common architectural features all define the physical world characters inhabit.

---

## Entertainment Technology

What entertainment exists (live music, recorded music, theater, games, sports, storytelling) and what technology enables it (musical instruments, game equipment, performance spaces) shape leisure and culture.

---

## Luxury vs. Necessity

The divide between technologies that are luxuries only the wealthy can afford, those available to everyone, and those completely unavailable to the poor creates class dynamics and story tension.

---

## Magic & Technology Integration

Whether magic replaces certain technologies (what technology doesn't exist because magic fills the need), enhances technology (enchanted items, magitech), or conflicts with technology (does magic interfere with technology or vice versa) defines the world's character. Who has access to magical vs. technological solutions creates another axis of inequality.

---

## Lost or Forbidden Technology

Past civilizations may have had technology now lost -- what was lost, why, and whether it could be rediscovered add mystery and stakes. Technology that is restricted or forbidden -- what's restricted, who restricts it and why, and the consequences for using it -- creates additional tension.

---

## Technology & Your Characters

Once you've established your world's technology level, consider how it specifically affects your characters. Technology gaps between them, how they communicate when separated, what privacy they have, how servants or attendants affect privacy, medical issues, contraception, and whether they could marry secretly with no record all shape the relationship.

---

## Final Thought: Technology Defines What's Possible

Your technology level determines what's easy and what's impossible.

If instant communication exists, separation loses weight. If healing magic fixes anything, danger has no teeth. If documentation doesn't exist, identity can be fluid. If privacy is impossible, intimacy becomes a risk.

Choose your technology level deliberately:
- Slow travel makes distance meaningful
- Limited communication creates longing and uncertainty
- Lack of privacy forces discretion
- Limited medicine makes injuries matter
- Absent documentation allows secrets

Technology isn't about gadgets -- it's about what your world makes easy and what it makes hard. Build a technology level that creates the constraints your story needs, then let your characters navigate those constraints.

The question isn't "what cool technology exists?" It's "what does my technology level make possible, and what does it prevent?"
