These sheets are designed for easy access while writing. Fill them in as you complete other sections, then keep them accessible during drafting.

## How to Use This Section

**When to fill this in:**
- After completing each section of the workbook, transfer key answers here
- Before starting to draft, review and complete any gaps
- During drafting, update with new details you establish

**How to use while writing:**
- Keep these sheets open (printed or in a separate window)
- Check before writing any scene: Are my details consistent?
- Add new details in "Things I've Established Mid-Draft" as you create them

**The goal:** Never pause mid-scene wondering "how does this work?" or "did I establish this?" The answers are here.

## THE INTEGRATION MANTRA

(Reference: Section 19 — World-Romance Integration)

**Every worldbuilding element should do at least two of these:**

1. Push characters together OR pull them apart (ideally both)
2. Create opportunities for intimacy OR obstacles to overcome
3. Force meaningful choices with real costs
4. Have consistent rules the romance works within
5. Matter to both the fantasy plot AND the relationship

**If an element doesn't do at least two of these, cut it or strengthen it.**

Keep these sheets accessible. Update as your story evolves.

Happy writing!
