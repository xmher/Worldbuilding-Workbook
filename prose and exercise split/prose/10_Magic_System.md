# SECTION 10: Building Your Magic System — The Foundation

## Prose

---

Magic is often what makes a fantasy world feel like *fantasy*. But magic that can do anything is magic that means nothing. The most memorable magic systems have rules, costs, and limits--and those constraints are what make them interesting. When your character reaches for their power, we need to know what they're risking, what they're capable of, and what's completely beyond them.

This section builds your magic from the ground up: where it comes from, who can use it, how it works, and--most importantly--what it *can't* do. Get this foundation right, and your magic will feel real. Skip it, and you'll find yourself writing your way into corners or solving problems too easily.

One more thing before we dive in: magic in romantasy isn't just about battles and plot problems. It's also about *intimacy*--how your characters connect, what they hide from each other, what it means when they finally let someone see their power (or their vulnerability). As you build your system, keep one eye on how magic might bring your leads together or push them apart.

## Reference: Types of Magic Systems

Magic doesn't have to mean spellcasting. Here are different approaches to inspire you--mix and match, or invent your own.

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Elemental** | Control over natural forces (fire, water, earth, air, etc.) | Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Priory of the Orange Tree |
| **Spellcasting/Incantation** | Words, gestures, or rituals produce specific effects | Harry Potter, The Name of the Wind |
| **Innate/Inborn Abilities** | Powers you're born with, often tied to bloodline or species | X-Men, Graceling, Ninth House |
| **Blood/Sacrifice Magic** | Power drawn from blood, pain, or giving something up | Blood and Ash series, Daughter of No Worlds |
| **Emotional/Will-Based** | Magic fueled by feelings, desire, or force of will | The Rage of Dragons, Green Lantern |
| **Bond-Based** | Magic tied to a connection with another being (familiar, dragon, mate) | Fourth Wing, His Dark Materials, Pern |
| **Artifact/Object-Based** | Power resides in objects, not people | Lord of the Rings, Howl's Moving Castle |
| **Transformation/Shifter** | Ability to change form--into animals, elements, other people | ACOTAR (shifting), Skin of the Sea |
| **Death/Necromancy** | Power over death, spirits, or the boundary between life and death | Gideon the Ninth, Sabriel |
| **Bargain/Contract Magic** | Power gained through deals, oaths, or binding agreements | ACOTAR (bargains), Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell |
| **Symbiotic/Parasitic** | Magic requires or is enhanced by another being | Venom, The Fifth Season |
| **Music/Art-Based** | Creation through song, art, or creative expression | Wintersong, The Singing Hills Cycle |
| **Knowledge/True Names** | Power comes from knowing the true nature of things | Earthsea, The Name of the Wind |
| **Psychic/Mental** | Mind-reading, telekinesis, projection, mental influence | Shatter Me series, Carrie |

## The Source

Every magic system has an origin--where the power actually comes from. This shapes everything else: who has access, how it's viewed by society, and what it costs to use.

The source could be: the gods or divine forces, the natural world (ley lines, elemental forces, the land itself), an internal source (bloodlines, souls, emotions), external objects (artifacts, crystals, runes), knowledge and study (spells, rituals, ancient texts), a bargain or bond (with spirits, demons, the fae, dragons), or something unknown or mysterious.

*Romantasy check: Could the source of magic connect your leads--or divide them?*

*Sometimes magic creates multiple layers of division--and not all of them are visible at first. In ACOTAR:* Feyre is human; Tamlin is High Fae. That's the obvious gap--she's mortal and powerless in his world, she'll age and die while he stays the same, and she can never fully belong to a realm that runs on magic she can't access. But there's also something he's not telling her. He's hiding something about why she's really there, and she can feel it--the evasions, the things he won't explain, the way everyone in his court seems to be waiting for something. The reader and protagonist experience the divide as a mystery: *why won't he tell me the truth?* The answer, when it comes, reframes everything.

*Or the division might be more straightforward:* Magic runs through noble bloodlines, and she's aristocracy while he's common-born and supposedly powerless--except he's developing abilities that shouldn't exist in someone like him, and if anyone finds out, she'll have to choose between her family and protecting his secret. Or: She draws power from the sun god while he's blessed by the moon goddess--their magic is strongest when the other's is weakest. Or: Her magic comes from a pact with spirits he's sworn to destroy.

---

## Who Can Use Magic

Not everyone has to be magical--and who *can* wield magic shapes everything from social structure to your protagonist's place in the world.

Think about it as a spectrum: Can nearly everyone use some form of magic? Is it limited to certain bloodlines, species, or chosen ones? Can anyone learn it with enough training and resources? Is it vanishingly rare--one in a thousand, one in a million?

What determines whether someone can use magic could be: birth (bloodlines, species, being "chosen"), training and study, a triggering event (trauma, near-death, ritual), possession of an object or bond with a creature, random chance, or a sacrifice or bargain made.

*Romantasy check: How does who can use magic affect the dynamic between your leads?*

*In Serpent & Dove:* Lou is a witch hiding her magic; Reid is a witch hunter sworn to kill her kind. It's not just that one has magic and one doesn't--it's that his entire identity is built on destroying what she is. She has to hide her true self every moment they're together, and he doesn't know that the woman he's falling for is exactly the thing he's been trained to hate. The question isn't just "who has power"--it's "what happens when he finds out?"

*Or the dynamic might play out differently:* He's the most powerful mage in a generation; she has no magic at all--but she's the only one willing to tell him the truth, and he's realized he needs someone who sees *him*, not his power. Or: They're both magical, but her abilities are celebrated while his are considered dark and forbidden--she's the kingdom's darling, and he's what mothers warn their children about. Or: She had magic once, before it was burned out of her as punishment; he's the one who did it, following orders he now regrets.

---

## How Magic Works

This is the mechanical heart of your system--the "physics" of magic. You don't need to explain everything to readers, but *you* should understand how it operates so your story stays consistent.

How someone actually does magic could involve: spoken words or incantations, physical gestures or movement, intense concentration or meditation, drawing symbols or runes, channeling through objects (wands, staffs, crystals), emotional states (rage, love, fear), rituals with specific components, physical contact or proximity, visualization or mental focus, music, dance, or artistic creation.

*Romantasy check: Is there anything about how magic is performed that creates vulnerability or intimacy?*

*In Fourth Wing:* Dragon riders share a mental bond with their dragons--and sometimes with each other. Violet and Xaden can speak mind-to-mind, which sounds romantic until you realize it means he knows when she's scared, when she's lying, when she's thinking about him. There's nowhere to hide. The bond doesn't just connect them; it strips away the walls they've both built. Intimacy isn't a choice--it's a consequence of the magic, whether they're ready for it or not.

*Or vulnerability might come from the process itself:* Magic requires absolute focus, so she can only cast when she trusts someone to watch her back--and he's the first person she's trusted that much in years. Or: Power flows through touch, which means every time she heals him, she feels everything he feels--including what he feels about her. Or: His magic flares when his emotions are strong, so she always knows when she's affected him, no matter how cold he acts.

---

## The Cost

This is where your magic system gets genuinely interesting. Unlimited power is boring; power with a price creates drama. What does magic take from the user--and is it worth paying?

Common costs include: physical energy or exhaustion, pain or physical damage, shortened lifespan or accelerated aging, emotional toll (memories fade, feelings dull, sanity frays), rare materials or components consumed in use, time and extensive preparation, moral or spiritual cost (corruption, debt, loss of humanity), or something taken from the world around them (heat, life, color).

There are also situational or plot-driven costs--times when magic *can't* be used safely even if the user has the power.

*In ACOTAR:* Rhysand is immensely powerful, but for much of the story he has to limit his magic use because the enemy can track it. The cost isn't physical--it's tactical. Using his full power would reveal his location and endanger everyone he's protecting. This creates tension because we know he *could* solve problems with magic, but the situation won't let him.

Think about: Can magic be tracked, sensed, or traced? Are there times when using magic would alert enemies, break a cover, or violate a treaty? Does magic leave evidence? Are there political or social consequences for using certain powers?

*Romantasy check: How might the cost of magic create romantic tension or sacrifice?*

*In From Blood and Ash:* Poppy's gift lets her sense others' emotions and take away their pain--but it means absorbing that pain into herself. Every time she helps someone, she suffers for it. When she uses her power on Hawke, she's not just healing him; she's choosing to hurt for him. And he doesn't miss what it costs her. The magic creates a cycle: she gives, he sees, he tries to protect her from her own compassion, she resents being protected. Her power is a gift that looks like self-destruction.

*Or the cost might create different tensions:* His power is fueled by strong emotion, which means falling in love makes him more powerful but also more dangerous; the more he feels for her, the harder he is to control. Or: Magic costs memories, and she's been using so much power that she's starting to forget why she's fighting--including starting to forget him. Or: The price of his greatest spell was "the thing you love most," and he cast it before he met her, which means the debt is still waiting to be collected.

## The Limits

What magic *cannot* do is more important than what it can. Limits create stakes, force creativity, and prevent your characters from solving every problem with a wave of their hand.

### Reference: Types of Magic Limitations

Use this table to think through different ways to constrain magic in your world. Effective systems usually have multiple types of limitations working together.

| Limitation Type | Examples | Story Function |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| **Impossible Acts** | Can't raise the truly dead, can't create genuine love, can't time travel, can't grant true immortality, can't create something from nothing | Creates absolute stakes--some problems *must* be solved without magic |
| **Material Weaknesses** | Iron disrupts fae magic, silver harms werewolves, salt breaks enchantments, running water grounds power, certain stones block or absorb magic | Gives non-magical characters a fighting chance; creates vulnerability |
| **Environmental Limits** | Magic fails in certain locations (dead zones, holy ground), weakens at certain times (daylight, new moon), doesn't work underwater or underground | Controls where magic can solve problems; creates dangerous/safe spaces |
| **Physical State** | Can't use magic when exhausted, injured, sick, or emotionally compromised; requires clear focus or calm | Makes physical danger matter even to powerful magic users |
| **Knowledge/Skill Caps** | Must learn specific abilities, must understand something to affect it, years of training required for advanced magic | Justifies why powerful magic is rare; creates expertise hierarchies |
| **Resource Depletion** | Energy runs out and must recover, rare components consumed, limited uses per day/week, power waxes and wanes with external cycles | Creates tactical decisions; prevents unlimited magic use |
| **Backlash/Consequences** | Overuse causes damage, failed magic backfires, dark magic corrupts the user, power attracts dangerous attention | Makes every magical choice meaningful and risky |
| **Range and Scale** | Can only affect things you can see, touch, or name; power diminishes with distance; can't affect large areas or many targets | Keeps magic personal and tactical rather than world-breaking |
| **Countermeasures** | Other magic users can block or dispel, certain creatures are immune, wards and protections exist, magical "arms races" | Creates strategic depth and prevents any one power from dominating |
| **Social/Legal Limits** | Magic is illegal, regulated, taxed, or taboo; using certain powers marks you as criminal or outcast | Creates external conflict beyond the magic itself |
| **Specificity** | Fire mages can't do ice magic, healers can't harm, each person has only one gift, powers don't overlap | Requires teamwork and creates complementary character dynamics |
| **Consent/Will** | Can't affect someone who truly resists, can't read an unwilling mind, bargains require genuine agreement | Protects character agency; limits mental/emotional magic |

*Romantasy check: Do any of your limitations create romantic tension or complications?*

*In The Cruel Prince:* The Fae cannot lie. It sounds like a small rule, but it shapes everything. Cardan can't tell Jude a direct lie--so every cruel thing he says, she knows he means. And every rare moment of honesty hits harder because she knows it's true; he literally cannot say "I love you" unless he does. The limitation forces both of them to become masters of misdirection, half-truths, and lies of omission. When the truth finally comes, it's devastating precisely because neither of them can hide behind "I didn't mean it."

*Or limitations might create different complications:* Her magic doesn't work on anyone she loves, a limitation she discovers at the worst possible moment when she can't shield him from an attack. Or: Magic fails in iron, and his family's ancestral home is built with iron bones--she literally cannot be herself within his walls. Or: His shapeshifting doesn't fool people who truly know him, and she's the first person to see through every mask.

---

## Scale and Power

Not all magic users are created equal. Understanding the range of power in your world--from the weakest hedge witch to the most terrifying archmage--helps you place your characters and set stakes appropriately.

*Romantasy check: If there's a power gap between your leads, how do you balance the relationship?*

*In ACOTAR (later books):* Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in Prythian's history. Feyre starts as a human with nothing. But the story doesn't let that gap make her irrelevant--she gains power, yes, but more importantly, she has things he needs that have nothing to do with magic: she sees through his masks, she challenges his decisions, she refuses to be protected when she could be fighting beside him. He's spent centuries being the most powerful person in every room; she's the first person who treats him like a man instead of a weapon. Power isn't just magic--it's also who's willing to call you on your bullshit.

*Or you might balance the gap differently:* Her magic is small, almost useless: she can make plants grow slightly faster. But he's been poisoned with something that's slowly killing him, and her "useless" gift is the only thing keeping him alive long enough to find a cure. Or: She's powerful and he's not, but he's the one who grew up on the streets and knows how to survive when magic fails--in the dead zones, he's the one keeping her alive. Or: They're equals in power but opposites in type; neither could defeat the other, which is the only reason they're still talking instead of fighting.

---

## Types and Specializations

Some worlds have one kind of magic; others have many flavors. Understanding whether your magic is a single force or a diverse ecosystem affects how characters relate to their powers--and to each other.

*Romantasy check: How do your leads' magic types interact?*

*In Gideon the Ninth:* Harrow is a necromancer--she works with bones and death. Gideon is her cavalier, a swordswoman with no magic at all. They're supposed to function as a unit: the necromancer does the magic, the cavalier does the fighting and provides... something else. The whole system is built on the idea that these two types need each other, that a necromancer without a cavalier is incomplete. But Harrow and Gideon hate each other. The magic demands partnership; their history demands distance. The tension isn't about their powers clashing--it's about two people who are magically designed to be partners but emotionally unable to trust each other.

*Or the interaction might be more direct:* His fire and her ice should be opposites, but when their powers touch, they create something neither can make alone: a mist that hides armies, a steam that powers engines, a balance that shouldn't be possible. Or: They have the same type of magic, which means they can feel each other casting--every spell she does, he feels like a tug in his chest, and he hates that she knows when he's using his power because she can feel him too. Or: Her magic amplifies whatever it touches, and she's terrified to touch him because she doesn't know if she'd make him stronger or burn him out entirely.

## Hard Magic vs. Soft Magic: Where Does Your System Land?

Now that you've built your system, let's step back and look at it as a whole. Magic systems exist on a spectrum between "hard" and "soft"--and knowing where yours falls helps you use it effectively.

**Hard Magic** has clearly defined rules, costs, and limitations. Readers understand what magic can and can't do, so when a character solves a problem with magic, it feels earned--we saw the tools, we understand the constraints. Hard magic is satisfying for problem-solving plots.

*Examples: Mistborn (specific metals grant specific powers), Fullmetal Alchemist (equivalent exchange), The Name of the Wind (sympathy follows strict rules)*

**Soft Magic** is mysterious, atmospheric, and not fully explained. It creates wonder and danger because we *don't* know its limits. Soft magic works best for creating mood, establishing threat, or showing that some things are beyond mortal understanding. The risk: if you solve major plot problems with undefined magic, it can feel like cheating.

*Examples: Lord of the Rings (Gandalf's magic is vague and wondrous), Game of Thrones (blood magic, the Others--mysterious and unpredictable), Uprooted (the Wood's corruption)*

**Most romantasy falls somewhere in between**--defined enough that readers understand stakes, mysterious enough to feel magical. You might have clear rules for everyday magic but unknowable forces at the edges of the world.

HARD <------------------------------------------------> SOFT
(Clear rules,                                    (Mysterious,
readers understand                               wonder and
how it works)                                    danger)

---

## Magic in Your Story

You've built the system. Now let's make sure it actually *works* for the story you're telling--both the plot and the romance.

### Magic and Plot

How does magic create or complicate your central conflict? Not just "there's a magical villain"--how do the *rules* of your magic shape what's possible?

### Act 1: Setup -- The Inciting Incident

How does magic launch your protagonist into the story?

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre kills a faerie--a magical creature--in the woods. She doesn't fully understand what she's done, but magic makes the kill possible and magic brings the consequences: Tamlin arrives to claim her life or take her to his realm. The inciting incident isn't just "something happens"; it's "something magical happens that she can't undo."

In romantasy, the fantasy inciting incident and the meet-cute should be linked.

### Act 2: Rising Action -- Building Tension

How does magic complicate the growing relationship?

*In ACOTAR:* As Feyre spends time in the Spring Court, she's surrounded by magic she doesn't understand and can't use. Every beautiful thing--the food, the music, the immortality--reminds her that she doesn't belong. Meanwhile, the curse (which she doesn't know about yet) is ticking down, adding urgency that Tamlin can't explain. Magic isn't just backdrop; it's pressure.

### Act 3: Crisis -- Everything Falls Apart

How does magic contribute to the "dark night of the soul"?

*In ACOTAR:* The curse breaks--sort of. Feyre says she loves Tamlin, but it's not enough, and Amarantha takes them all Under the Mountain. Magic becomes a prison: Feyre is powerless among the most powerful beings in the world, Tamlin is bound and can't help her, and the trials she faces are magical torments designed to destroy her. The very magic that drew them together now seems to make saving each other impossible.

### Act 4: Resolution -- The Climax

How does magic enable the resolution--and how is the romantic resolution tied to the magical one?

*In ACOTAR:* Feyre solves Amarantha's riddle (a magical test), and the answer itself is "love." Her willingness to die for Tamlin breaks the curse. But she does die--and is resurrected by the High Lords' magic, transformed into something new. The romantic sacrifice (dying for him) triggers the magical solution (breaking the curse), which transforms her (she becomes Fae). The romantic climax IS the magical climax.

### Magic and Your World

We'll dig deeper into magic's effects on society, economy, and politics in later sections. For now, consider initial thoughts on how magic has shaped the power structures in your world -- who's on top because of magic and who's at the bottom -- and what non-magical people think of magic users (fear, reverence, resentment, envy, exploitation).

---

### Magic and Romance

This is romantasy, so let's get specific about how your magic system affects the relationship at the heart of your story.

Magical bonds, bargains, or connections between people (soul bonds, mating marks, magical contracts, shared power) raise questions: Are they chosen or fated? Can they be broken? What does your story say about destiny vs. choice?

Magic can create obstacles between leads: forbidden types of magic, power imbalances, magic that makes trust difficult (mind reading, illusion, shapeshifting), duties or costs that pull them apart, being on opposite sides of a magical conflict.

Magic can also create connection: shared abilities or training, one can help/heal/protect the other, magical communication when apart, complementary powers, moments where using magic together creates intimacy.

Consider what it would mean for your protagonist to use their magic *for* their love interest--not in battle, but in a personal, private way. Maybe it's protective, or generous, or reveals something they usually hide.

Consider also what it would mean for your protagonist to use their magic *in front of* their love interest in a way they don't show others--revealing their full power, their vulnerability, or a secret aspect of their abilities.

---

## Consistency Check

Before you move on, make sure your magic system holds together. Check for contradictions (for example: "Magic is extremely rare" but also "Every noble family has a court mage"). Think about the biggest problem your protagonist faces and whether a skeptical reader would ask "Why didn't they just use magic to fix that?" You should have an answer.
