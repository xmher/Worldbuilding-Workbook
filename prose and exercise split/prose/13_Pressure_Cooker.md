# SECTION 13: The Pressure Cooker — Forced Proximity by Design

You've already built geography that isolates (Section 1) and institutions that bind (Section 14). This section is about *using* those elements to create sustained proximity — settings that function as pressure systems, compressing your characters together until avoiding each other becomes impossible.

The "only one bed" trope works because it removes the option of avoidance. In romantasy, you can scale this principle up to entire settings — academies where students share dorms, ships where passengers can't escape each other, journeys through dangerous terrain where separation means death.

**Pressure cooker settings do three crucial things:**

1. **Remove the option to leave** — Characters are trapped together by geography, obligation, or danger
2. **Force constant interaction** — Privacy is limited; they see each other daily (or constantly)
3. **Accelerate intimacy** — Compressed proximity speeds up relationship development that might take months in normal circumstances

This section helps you design how your setting functions as a pressure system — not just where your characters are trapped, but *how* that entrapment forces them to confront their feelings, conflicts, and attraction.

## The Core Principle: Why They Can't Leave

Before anything else, answer this: **What prevents your characters from simply avoiding each other?**

The strongest pressure cookers have multiple layers of constraint.

---

## Physical Pressure vs. Emotional Pressure

Physical constraints are obvious — walls, geography, locks. But emotional stakes can make leaving feel impossible even when it's technically possible.

---

## Other People in the Pressure Cooker

Forced proximity rarely means just the two of them. Others in the space change everything — creating audience, competition, threat, or alliance.

---

## Forced Interaction Points

Within your pressure cooker, what specific situations force interaction?

---

## Routines & Rhythms

Daily life in confinement creates patterns. Repeated moments become significant. What starts as obligation can become ritual.

---

## Relief & Breathing Room

Constant pressure isn't sustainable — for characters or readers. Moments of relief make the pressure meaningful by contrast.

---

## Escalating the Pressure

Pressure should increase over time, not remain static. The container should tighten.

---

## How Confinement Changes Them

Proximity reveals things distance hides. Stress brings out truth. By the end of confinement, they should know each other differently than they did at the start.

---

## Scaling Proximity

Pressure cookers exist at different scales. You might use multiple levels throughout your story.

---

## Privacy Within Proximity

Even in forced proximity, characters need moments alone — and moments alone *together*.

---

## The Diagnostic Question

**If my characters tried to walk away from each other right now, what would stop them?**

If the answer is "nothing" or "they'd feel bad," your pressure cooker doesn't have enough grip.

**Strong answers:**
- They'd be executed for desertion
- The magical bond would kill them both
- Their families would go to war
- They'd lose their only chance at survival/power/freedom
- The enemy would capture them immediately
- They'd be stripped of their magic and exiled
- One of them would die without the other's protection
- The mission would fail and people would die

**Weak answers:**
- They'd feel guilty
- It would be awkward
- They'd miss each other
- Someone might be disappointed

## Final Thought: Pressure Creates Transformation

Forced proximity doesn't guarantee romance — it creates the conditions where connection *must* happen faster and more intensely than it would otherwise.

The pressure cooker strips away the option to avoid, to think about it later, to take things slow. Characters must confront their feelings, their conflicts, and their attraction because there's nowhere else to go.

But proximity also reveals truth. In close quarters, pretense becomes exhausting. Masks slip. Walls crumble. They see each other — truly — because there's no room to hide.

The setting creates the pressure. Your characters create the heat. Design your pressure cooker to force them together, then let their choices within that confinement show who they really are and what they really want.

The best forced proximity makes separation impossible — but the characters still have to choose each other. The pressure cooker removes the option to run; it doesn't remove the need to decide.
