# SECTION 17: The Consistency Check

Consistency isn't about being rigid — it's about keeping promises. When you establish a rule (magic costs blood, teleportation is impossible, lies are magically detectable), readers trust that rule will hold. If you break it without explanation, you break that trust.

In romantasy, the temptation to break rules is constant. You need your characters to kiss, so suddenly the guards aren't patrolling. You need them separated, so suddenly the teleportation that worked before doesn't. You need tension, so the character who could read minds in chapter three mysteriously forgets that ability in chapter ten.

This is the "vibes vs. logic" problem: prioritizing what feels romantic over what makes logical sense in your world. While romantasy readers suspend disbelief for love stories, they won't forgive a world that only works when it's convenient.

This section helps you test your worldbuilding's internal logic and catch inconsistencies before they undermine your story.

---

## A Note Before You Begin

**This section works best during revision.** Inconsistencies emerge through writing — you can't fully check until you've established what needs to be consistent. **Some inconsistencies matter more than others** — magic rules and stated consequences are critical; background details are flexible. **Readers are forgiving of love** — they accept coincidences that bring characters together, but won't accept rules that only apply when convenient.

---

## Prioritizing Consistency

Not all consistency matters equally. Before diving into detailed checks, understand what's critical versus what's flexible.

### Critical Consistency (Must Hold)

These breaks will seriously damage reader trust:

- **Magic rules** — If magic costs something in chapter one, it should cost the same thing in chapter twenty
- **Character abilities** — Powers shouldn't appear or disappear based on plot needs
- **Stated consequences** — If you establish that discovery means death, discovery must mean death
- **Physical limitations** — Travel times, distances, and environmental dangers

### Flexible Consistency (Can Bend)

These can flex slightly without breaking trust:

- **Minor timing** — Exact travel times can vary if not plot-critical
- **Background details** — The color of a minor character's eyes, the name of a tavern
- **Vague power levels** — "Very powerful" can mean different things in different contexts
- **Coincidences that bring characters together** — This is romance; fate is expected

### The Key Question

**Am I bending rules to serve the story, or breaking them to avoid consequences?**

Bending: The guards are absent because there's a festival (established earlier).
Breaking: The guards are absent because I needed them gone for this scene.

---

## The Rules You've Established

### Magic Rules

(Reference: Section 10 — Magic System)

**What are the 3-5 most important rules of your magic system?**

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

5. ____________________________________________________________

**Have you ever bent or broken these rules for plot convenience?**

If yes — was there an in-world explanation, or did you just need it to work differently?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Political/Legal Rules

(Reference: Section 5 — Government, Power & Law)

**What are the most important laws or political realities?**

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

**Have characters broken these laws without facing stated consequences?**

If yes — why didn't they face consequences? Will readers accept that reason?

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Social/Cultural Rules

(Reference: Section 3 — Culture, Customs & Daily Life)

**What are the unbreakable customs or taboos?**

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

**Do characters violate these customs — and do others react appropriately?**

If a character breaks a taboo and no one reacts, readers notice.

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### Physical/Environmental Rules

(Reference: Section 1 — Geography; Section 9 — Technology)

**What are the physical limitations of your world?**

Travel times, communication speed, environmental dangers, seasonal constraints:

1. ____________________________________________________________

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

4. ____________________________________________________________

**Have these limitations stopped mattering when inconvenient?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

## The "Would This Actually Happen?" Test

For major plot points, especially romantic moments, ask: Given my rules, would this actually happen?

**Describe a key romantic scene:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Apply your rules:**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| If guards patrol this area, where are they during this scene? | |
| If magic can detect lies/emotions/presence, why doesn't it detect this? | |
| If this location is dangerous, why hasn't the danger manifested? | |
| If discovery means severe punishment, why risk it here and now? | |
| If other characters would intervene, why don't they? | |

### The Reversal Test

**What would actually happen if they were caught?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Who would catch them, and why haven't they?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Is there a good in-world reason they don't get caught, or are you just protecting them?**

_______________________________________________________________

If you're just protecting them, add a reason (lookout, shift change, concealment magic, distraction) or let them get caught and deal with consequences.

## The Convenience Check

### Powers and Abilities

**List your protagonist's key abilities:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**List your love interest's key abilities:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Do abilities remain consistent in power level?**

A character who fights off ten soldiers in one scene but loses to two in another (without explanation like injury, exhaustion, or magical interference) is inconsistent.

_______________________________________________________________

**Does anyone forget an ability that would solve the current problem?**

_______________________________________________________________

### Environmental Consistency

**Map key locations and travel times:**

| From | To | Travel Time |
|------|-----|-------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Have you changed these times for plot convenience?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Do environmental dangers remain consistent?**

If the forest is full of monsters in one chapter, it should still be dangerous in the next (unless something changed).

_______________________________________________________________

### Authority and Surveillance

**Are authority figures consistently present or absent?**

Do guards only patrol when you need tension, then vanish when you need privacy?

_______________________________________________________________

**Does surveillance (magical or mundane) work consistently?**

_______________________________________________________________

**Fix:** If you need guards absent, show why (disturbance elsewhere, shift change, bribe, festival, deliberate distraction). Don't just have them disappear.

## The "Vibes vs. Logic" Problem

### Identifying Vibes-Over-Logic Moments

Check if you've done any of these:

☐ Magic with strict rules suddenly works differently for a romantic moment

☐ Political danger that drives the plot pauses completely for romantic scenes

☐ Characters have privacy in places that should be public or monitored

☐ Consequences you've established don't apply when protagonists break rules

☐ Worldbuilding obstacles disappear when they become inconvenient

☐ Characters forget abilities, knowledge, or resources that would help

**How many did you check?**

0-1: You're probably fine.
2-3: Review these specific instances.
4+: You have a pattern to address.

### Fixing Vibes-Over-Logic Problems

For each issue, you have three options:

**Option 1: Add an in-world explanation**
If magic works differently here, establish earlier that it can work this way under specific conditions. If guards are absent, show why.

**Option 2: Accept the consequences**
Let them get caught. Let the rule-breaking be a plot point, not a convenience. Often this creates better story.

**Option 3: Change the rule**
If you keep breaking this rule, maybe it's wrong. Make it less restrictive from the start so you don't have to keep working around it.

## Does the Fantasy Plot Pause for the Romance?

### The Timeline Test

**Outline major fantasy plot points and romantic beats chronologically:**

| Plot Point | Romantic Beat |
|------------|---------------|
| 1. | 1. |
| 2. | 2. |
| 3. | 3. |
| 4. | 4. |

**Do fantasy plot points stop advancing when romance heats up?**

Example problem: The dark lord marches toward the city but waits patiently while protagonists have a three-chapter relationship arc with no external pressure.

_______________________________________________________________

**Do romantic beats happen during plot events or in pauses between them?**

**Ideal:** First kiss while hiding from enemies. Confession after surviving battle together. Argument because they disagree on mission strategy. Intimacy when they might die tomorrow.

**Less ideal:** Plot pauses entirely for romantic cabin retreat with no time pressure or external stakes.

_______________________________________________________________

### The Pressure Test

**For each major romantic moment, what external pressure is active?**

Ticking clock, pursuing enemy, deadline, magical countdown, someone who might discover them, limited time before forced separation, danger that could interrupt?

| Romantic Moment | Active External Pressure |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

If any moment has no external pressure, consider adding one. Romance under pressure is more compelling than romance in a vacuum.

### The Dual Clock

**Your fantasy plot deadline:**

(War reaches city, curse takes effect, prophecy deadline passes, trial concludes, army arrives)

_______________________________________________________________

**Your romantic plot deadline:**

(When they must make final choice about each other, point of no return for the relationship)

_______________________________________________________________

**Do these deadlines converge?**

**Ideal:** Must defeat enemy together, which requires trust they haven't built. Must break curse by admitting love. Political marriage deadline is also war deadline. Confession must happen before battle they might not survive.

_______________________________________________________________

If deadlines are separate, can you align them?

_______________________________________________________________

---

## Character Knowledge Consistency

### Information Tracking

**What does your protagonist know (and when did they learn it)?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does your love interest know (and when did they learn it)?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**What does protagonist know that love interest doesn't?**

_______________________________________________________________

**What does love interest know that protagonist doesn't?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Reveal Check

**Your major revelation or secret:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Could this character have figured this out earlier?**

If yes — why didn't they? Good reasons: deliberately avoiding it, couldn't bear to know, information was genuinely hidden, had no reason to look. Bad reasons: just didn't think to ask, plot needed them not to know yet.

_______________________________________________________________

**Does any character act on information they shouldn't have yet?**

_______________________________________________________________

### The Misunderstanding Check

**Your major misunderstanding:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Why don't they just ask each other directly?**

| Good Reasons | Bad Reasons |
|--------------|-------------|
| Cultural taboo against directness | Just didn't think to ask |
| Fear of rejection or vulnerability | Plot needs them not to know |
| Asking would reveal dangerous secret | Avoiding conversation for drama |
| No privacy to have conversation | Characters being unnecessarily stupid |
| Magical compulsion prevents honesty | Author needed conflict |
| Asking the question is itself risky | |

**Which applies to your story?**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

If they could resolve the misunderstanding with a single conversation but don't, readers get frustrated — unless there's a solid reason that conversation can't happen.

---

## The Internal Logic Test

For any major plot event, apply this three-part test:

### 1. The Setup Test

**Was this possibility established earlier?**

If magic does something new in the climax, was it hinted magic could do this? If a character reveals a hidden skill, were there earlier signs?

_______________________________________________________________

### 2. The Rules Test

**Does this outcome follow logically from established rules?**

Given what you've established about how your world works, does this make sense?

_______________________________________________________________

### 3. The Character Test

**Would these characters actually do this, given who they are and what they know?**

Not what you need them to do — what they would actually choose.

_______________________________________________________________

**Apply to your climax or major turning point:**

Event: _________________________________________________________

Setup Test — was this established? ________________________________

Rules Test — does this follow rules? _______________________________

Character Test — would they do this? ______________________________

If you answered "no" to any, you have a consistency problem to address.

---

## When to Break Your Own Rules

Sometimes you should break a rule — but intentionally, with explanation, and with impact.

### Justified Rule-Breaking

**1. The break is the point**
The entire story builds to this moment where the impossible becomes possible. Proper setup earns the payoff.

**2. There's an in-world explanation**
You introduced an exception earlier, or the break reveals new information about how things actually work.

**3. The consequence is severe**
Breaking the rule has a cost that makes the story more complex, not easier. The rule-break creates new problems.

**Have you intentionally broken a rule?**

The rule: ______________________________________________________

Why you broke it: _______________________________________________

What makes it justified: _________________________________________

What consequences follow: _______________________________________

## What Readers Will Forgive

Not all inconsistencies matter equally.

### Readers Will Usually Forgive:

- **Minor timing/distance variations** if the story is emotionally compelling
- **Vague power levels** if outcomes feel earned
- **Convenient coincidences** that bring characters together (this is romance — fate is expected)
- **Slightly flexible rules** if the flexibility is consistent
- **Offscreen solutions** to minor logistical problems
- **Characters making emotional rather than optimal decisions** (they're human)

### Readers Will NOT Forgive:

- **Rules that only apply to non-protagonists** (everyone else dies from this, but not our heroes)
- **Abilities that appear/disappear based on plot needs** (why didn't they just do what they did in chapter 3?)
- **Consequences that vanish** (huge danger established, then never pays off)
- **Characters acting stupid to preserve conflict** (just TALK to each other!)
- **Deus ex machina solutions** that weren't set up
- **The world stopping** so characters can have romantic moments with zero tension or external stakes

### The Difference

Readers forgive inconsistencies that serve emotion *if you've earned their trust* through generally consistent worldbuilding.

They don't forgive inconsistencies that feel like cheating — where you're protecting characters from your own rules, or making things easy when they should be hard.

**Ask:** Am I bending rules to serve the story, or breaking them to avoid consequences I don't want to write?

_______________________________________________________________

## Catching and Fixing Errors

### If You Catch It While Drafting:

**Option 1: Fix it going forward and revise backward**
Change earlier instances to match your new understanding of how things work.

**Option 2: Make the inconsistency a feature**
If magic worked differently once, maybe there's a reason. Turn the error into a mystery or revelation.

**Option 3: Acknowledge and explain**
Add a line explaining why this instance is different from established pattern.

### If You Catch It Late:

- Note it for revision
- If writing a series, you can sometimes address inconsistencies in later books
- Accept that readers may notice, but a strong story survives minor inconsistencies
- Major inconsistencies need fixing; minor ones can slide

### Using Beta Readers

Beta readers catch consistency errors you're blind to. Ask them specifically:

- Did anything feel too convenient or too easy?
- Did any rule seem to change without explanation?
- Did any character forget an ability or know something they shouldn't?
- Did the world feel consistent throughout?
- Were there moments that pulled you out of the story?

**Consistency questions for your beta readers:**

_______________________________________________________________

## Series Consistency

If this is book one of a series, you need to track rules across books.

### Create a Series Bible

Document and maintain:

**Magic rules and limitations:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Travel times between key locations:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Political structures and current power holders:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Character abilities and their established limits:**

_______________________________________________________________

**Major worldbuilding facts that can't change:**

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

### What to Track Across Books:

- Character ages and timeline progression
- Who knows what and when they learned it
- Relationship status and history between all characters
- Political situation changes book to book
- Any rule clarifications, expansions, or exceptions
- Consequences from previous books that should still matter

**Will you need a series bible?**

_______________________________________________________________

## The Consistency Checklist

Use this for any major plot point or romantic beat:

☐ Does this follow established magic rules?

☐ Does this follow established political/social rules?

☐ Are environmental conditions consistent with previous scenes?

☐ Do characters have only the knowledge and abilities they should have at this point?

☐ Are authority figures and obstacles present as established (or absent for good reason)?

☐ Does external plot pressure continue during this scene?

☐ If a rule is bent or broken, is there a clear in-world reason?

☐ Would readers who've been paying attention accept this?

## Final Thought: Trust Your Worldbuilding

Your world doesn't have to be perfectly realistic — it's fantasy. But it does have to be internally consistent. The rules you establish create boundaries that make choices meaningful. When characters break rules, it should cost them something. When they work within rules, victories should feel earned. When the impossible becomes possible, it should be wonder, not convenience.

Trust your worldbuilding. Let it create real obstacles. Love that overcomes real obstacles — grounded in consistent worldbuilding — means more than love that overcomes obstacles that conveniently disappear.

Build a world with rules. Then let your characters fight for each other within those rules. That's how you earn the happy ending.
